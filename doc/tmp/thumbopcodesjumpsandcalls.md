**THUMB.18: unconditional branch**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15-11  Must be 11100b for this type of instructions             |
|       N/A    Opcode (fixed)                                           |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted.
Execution Time: 2S+1N

**THUMB.19: long branch with link**
This may be used to call (or jump) to a subroutine, return address is
saved in LR (R14).
Unlike all other THUMB mode instructions, this instruction occupies
32bit of memory which are split into two 16bit THUMB opcodes.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      First Instruction - LR = PC+4+(nn SHL 12)                        |
|       15-11  Must be 11110b for BL/BLX type of instructions           |
|       10-0   nn - Upper 11 bits of Target Address                     |
|      Second                                                           |
| Instruction - PC = LR + (nn SHL 1), and LR = PC+2 OR 1 (and BLX: T=0) |
|       15-11  Opcode                                                   |
|               11111b: BL label   ;branch long with link               |
|                                                                       |
|   11101b: BLX label  ;branch long with link switch to ARM mode (ARM9) |
|                                                                       |
|  10-0   nn - Lower 11 bits of Target Address (BLX: Bit0 Must be zero) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The destination address range is (PC+4)-400000h..+3FFFFEh, ie. PC+/-4M.
Target must be halfword-aligned. As Bit 0 in LR is set, it may be used
to return by a BX LR instruction (keeping CPU in THUMB mode).
Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted, return address in LR.
Execution Time: 3S+1N (first opcode 1S, second opcode 2S+1N).
Note: Exceptions may or may not occur between first and second opcode,
this is \"implementation defined\" (unknown how this is implemented i
GBA and NDS).
Using only the 2nd half of BL as \"BL LR+imm\" is possible (for example
Mario Golf Advance Tour for GBA uses opcode F800h as \"BL LR+0\").

**THUMB.17: software interrupt and breakpoint**
SWI supposed for calls to the operating system - Enter Supervisor mode
(SVC) in ARM state. BKPT intended for debugging - enters Abort mode in
ARM state via Prefetch Abort vector.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15-8   Opcode                                                   |
|               11011111b: SWI nn   ;software interrupt                 |
|               10111110b: BKPT nn  ;software breakpoint (ARMv5 and up) |
|                                                                       |
|  7-0    nn - Comment Field, ignored by processor (8bit value) (0-255) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Execution Time: 2S+1N
The exception handler may interprete the SWI Comment Field by examining
- the lower 8bit of the 16bit opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-2\].
If your are also using SWI\'s from inside of ARM mode, then the SW
handler must examine the T Bit SPSR_svc in order to determine whether
it\'s been a ARM SWI - and if so, examine the lower 24bit of the 32bi
- opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-4\].
For Returning from SWI use \"MOVS PC,R14\", that instruction doe
restore both PC and CPSR, ie. PC=R14_svc, and CPSR=SPSR_svc, and (as
called from THUMB mode), it\'ll also restore THUMB mode.
Nesting SWIs: SPSR_svc and R14_svc should be saved on stack before
either invoking nested SWIs, or (if the IRQ handler uses SWIs) before
enabling IRQs.
Execution SWI/BKPT:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       R14_svc=PC+2     R14_abt=PC+4   ;save return address            |
|       SPSR_svc=CPSR    SPSR_abt=CPSR  ;save CPSR flags                |
|       CPS                                                             |
| R=<changed>   CPSR=<changed> ;Enter svc/abt, ARM state, IRQs disabled |
|       PC=V                                                            |
| VVV0008h     PC=VVVV000Ch   ;jump to SWI/PrefetchAbort vector address |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
