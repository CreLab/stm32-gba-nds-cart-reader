See also THUMB.5: BX Rs, and ADD/MOV PC,Rs.

### THUMB.18: unconditional branch

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15-11  Must be 11100b for this type of instructions             |
|       N/A    Opcode (fixed)                                           |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted.
Execution Time: 2S+1N

### THUMB.19: long branch with link
This may be used to call (or jump) to a subroutine, return address is saved in LR (R14).
Unlike all other THUMB mode instructions, this instruction occupies 32bit of memory which are split into two 16bit THUMB opcodes.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      First Instruction - LR = PC+4+(nn SHL 12)                                    |
|       15-11  Must be 11110b for BL/BLX type of instructions                       |
|       10-0   nn - Upper 11 bits of Target Address                                 |
|      Second Instruction - PC = LR + (nn SHL 1), and LR = PC+2 OR 1 (and BLX: T=0) |
|       15-11  Opcode                                                               |
|               11111b: BL label   ;branch long with link                           |
|               11101b: BLX label  ;branch long with link switch to ARM mode (ARM9) |
|       10-0   nn - Lower 11 bits of Target Address (BLX: Bit0 Must be zero)        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The destination address range is (PC+4)-400000h..+3FFFFEh, ie. PC+/-4M.
Target must be halfword-aligned. As Bit 0 in LR is set, it may be used to return by a BX LR instruction (keeping CPU in THUMB mode).
Return: No flags affected, PC adjusted, return address in LR.
Execution Time: 3S+1N (first opcode 1S, second opcode 2S+1N).
Note: Exceptions may or may not occur between first and second opcode, this is \"implementation defined\" (unknown how this is implemented in GBA and NDS).
Using only the 2nd half of BL as \"BL LR+imm\" is possible (for example, Mario Golf Advance Tour for GBA uses opcode F800h as \"BL LR+0\").

### THUMB.17: software interrupt and breakpoint
SWI supposed for calls to the operating system - Enter Supervisor mode (SVC) in ARM state. BKPT intended for debugging - enters Abort mode in ARM state via Prefetch Abort vector.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15-8   Opcode                                                        |
|               11011111b: SWI nn   ;software interrupt                      |
|               10111110b: BKPT nn  ;software breakpoint (ARMv5 and up)      |
|       7-0    nn - Comment Field, ignored by processor (8bit value) (0-255) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Execution Time: 2S+1N
The exception handler may interprete the SWI Comment Field by examining the lower 8bit of the 16bit opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-2\].
If your are also using SWI\'s from inside of ARM mode, then the SWI handler must examine the T Bit SPSR_svc in order to determine whether it\'s been a ARM SWI - and if so, examine the lower 24bit of the 32bit opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-4\].
For Returning from SWI use \"MOVS PC,R14\", that instruction does restore both PC and CPSR, ie. PC=R14_svc, and CPSR=SPSR_svc, and (as called from THUMB mode), it\'ll also restore THUMB mode.
Nesting SWIs: SPSR_svc and R14_svc should be saved on stack before either invoking nested SWIs, or (if the IRQ handler uses SWIs) before enabling IRQs.
Execution SWI/BKPT:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       R14_svc=PC+2     R14_abt=PC+4   ;save return address                      |
|       SPSR_svc=CPSR    SPSR_abt=CPSR  ;save CPSR flags                          |
|       CPSR=<changed>   CPSR=<changed> ;Enter svc/abt, ARM state, IRQs disabled  |
|       PC=VVVV0008h     PC=VVVV000Ch   ;jump to SWI/PrefetchAbort vector address |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
