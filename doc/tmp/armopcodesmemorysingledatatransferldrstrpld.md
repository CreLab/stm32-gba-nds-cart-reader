### Instruction Formats for \<Address\>
An expression which generates an address:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       <expression>                  ;an immediate used as address     |
###  restriction: must be located in range PC+/-4095+8, if so,  | |       ;*
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Pre-indexed addressing specification:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [Rn]                          ;offset = zero                          |
|       [Rn, <#{+/-}expression>]{!}   ;offset = immediate                     |
|       [Rn, {+/-}Rm{,<shift>} ]{!}   ;offset = register shifted by immediate |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Post-indexed addressing specification:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [Rn], <#{+/-}expression>      ;offset = immediate                     |
|       [Rn], {+/-}Rm{,<shift>}       ;offset = register shifted by immediate |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Whereas\...

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       <shift>  immediate shift such like LSL#4, ROR#2, etc. (see ALU opcodes).   |
|       {!}      exclamation mark ("!") indicates write-back (Rn will be updated). |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Notes
Shift amount 0 has special meaning, as described for ALU opcodes.
When writing a word (32bit) to memory, the address should be word-aligned.
When reading a byte from memory, upper 24 bits of Rd are zero-extended.
LDR PC,\<op\> on ARMv4 leaves CPSR.T unchanged.
LDR PC,\<op\> on ARMv5 sets CPSR.T to \<op\> Bit0, (1=Switch to Thumb).

When reading a word from a halfword-aligned address (which is located in the middle between two word-aligned addresses), the lower 16bit of Rd will contain \[address\] ie. the addressed halfword, and the upper 16bit of Rd will contain \[Rd-2\] ie. more or less unwanted garbage. However, by isolating lower bits this may be used to read a halfword from memory. (Above applies to little endian mode, as used in GBA.)

In a virtual memory based environment (ie. not in the GBA), aborts (ie. page faults) may take place during execution, if so, Rm and Rn should not specify the same register when post-indexing is used, as the abort-handler might have problems to reconstruct the original value of the register.

Return: CPSR flags are not affected.
Execution Time: For normal LDR: 1S+1N+1I. For LDR PC: 2S+2N+1I. For STR: 2N.

### PLD \<Address\> ;Prepare Cache for Load
PLD must use following settings cond=1111b, P=1, B=1, W=0, L=1, Rd=1111b, the address may not use post-indexing, and may not use writeback, the opcode is encoded identical as LDRNVB R15,\<Address\>.
PLD signalizes to the memory system that a specific memory address will be soon accessed, the memory system may use this hint to prepare caching/pipelining, aside from that, PLD does not have any affect to the program logic, and behaves identical as NOP.
PLD supported by ARMv5TE and up only, not ARMv5, not ARMv5TExP.
