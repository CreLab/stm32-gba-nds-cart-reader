# LCD VRAM BG Screen Data Format (BG Map)


The display background consists of 8x8 dot tiles, the arrangement of
these tiles is specified by the BG Screen Data (BG Map). The separate
entries in this map are as follows:

**Text BG Screen (2 bytes per entry)**
Specifies the tile number and attributes. Note that BG tile numbers are
always specified in steps of 1 (unlike OBJ tile numbers which are using
steps of two in 256 color/1 palette mode).

```

|       Bit   Expl.                                                     |
|                                                                       |
| 0-9   Tile Number     (0-1023) (a bit less in 256 color mode, because |
|                                                                       |
|                          there'd be otherwise no room for the bg map) |
|       10    Horizontal Flip (0=Normal, 1=Mirrored)                    |
|       11    Vertical Flip   (0=Normal, 1=Mirrored)                    |
|       1                                                               |
| 2-15 Palette Number  (0-15)    (Not used in 256 color/1 palette mode) |

```

A Text BG Map always consists of 32x32 entries (256x256 pixels), 400h
entries = 800h bytes. However, depending on the BG Size, one, two, or
four of these Maps may be used together, allowing to create backgrounds
of 256x256, 512x256, 256x512, or 512x512 pixels, if so, the first map
(SC0) is located at base+0, the next map (SC1) at base+800h, and so on.

**Rotation/Scaling BG Screen (1 byte per entry)**
In this mode, only 256 tiles can be used. There are no x/y-flip
attributes, the color depth is always 256 colors/1 palette.

|       0-7   Tile Number     (0-255)                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The dimensions of Rotation/Scaling BG Maps depend on the BG size. For
size 0-3 that are: 16x16 tiles (128x128 pixels), 32x32 tiles (256x256
pixels), 64x64 tiles (512x512 pixels), or 128x128 tiles (1024x1024
pixels).

The size and VRAM base address of the separate BG maps for BG0-3 are set
up by BG0CNT-BG3CNT registers.
