# 3DS Files - Sound IDs (CSID Format)


Some titles have the CSAR file bundled with a separate CSID file with .csid extension (eg. 3DS Health Safety RomFS:\\sound\\Main.csid and 3DS Instruction Manual applet RomFS:\\sound\\Main.csid), which appears to be a relict from devkit, used before/after generating the CSAR file.
The file contains Symbols and 32bit Resource IDs in ASCII, oddly, with an UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (EFh,BBh,BFh) in the file header.
