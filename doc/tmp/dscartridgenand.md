# DS Cartridge NAND


SLC-NAND is used in at least three NDS/DSi games. The ROM Chip ID has
bit3 in 4th byte set.

In the cart header, the 1st byte of the Gamecode is \"U\" (that \"U\" i
also used for a few other carts with \"uncommon\" hardware), and heade
- entries \[094h,096h\] indicate the end of the ROM region and start of R
region (in 128Kbyte units for NDS, or 512Kbyte units for DSi; exception:
the oldest NAND title (japanese version of Jam with the Band) did have
- \[094h,096h\] set to all zeroes). The chips are all 128MByte (122MByt
usable), with memory map as so:

```

|       00000000                                                        |
| h  ROM region (one large region)                                  (R) |
|       0xxx0000                                                        |
| h  RW region (split into several 128KByte blocks)               (R/W) |
|       07A00000                                                        |
| h  Reserved region                                                (R) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The RW space is 8MB for Jam with the Band, 16MB for WarioWare DIY, and
82MB in Face Training. Unknown if some of the cart memory is reserved
for broken sector handling.

**DS Cartridges with NAND memory**
NAND memory contains both the game and save memory (normal NDS games
contain separate ROM and SPI FLASH/EEPROM chips for that purposes). The
advantage is that NAND allows more storage than the usual FLASH chips.
Nintendo also claims SLC-NAND to be very fast, but that\'s only hal
true (it\'s much slower than MROM, but might be slightly faster than SP
FLASH).

**Command Summary**
For whatever reason, random access is slightly restricted: One must use
command 8Bh/B2h to select ROM region or a 128KByte RW window before
reading/writing the selected area. Writing is done in 2Kbyte units
(4x200h bytes).

```


- **81aaaaaaaa000000h - NAND Write to Write Buffer + Data\[200h\]**
The command must be issued 4 times with the same address (seems to use
the address from the first command), a full write is 800h bytes
(4x200h), the chip won\'t respond to other commands until all 4 command
are sent. Unknown what happens when trying to send more than 4
commands.
This command doesn\'t directly write to NAND, instead it stores th
incoming data in a 800h-byte write buffer (latter committed using
command 82h).
The provided address needs to be within the access window specified by
command B2h.

**8200000000000000h - NAND Forward Write Buffer to NAND**
The data in the 800h-byte write buffer is written to the actual NAND,
and the write-enable bit in the status register is cleared.

**8400000000000000h - NAND Discard Write Buffer**
The data in the write buffer is discarded (a subsequent command 82h
would have no effect).
Games seem to always use this after command 82h, so maybe it\'s require
even after a write.

**8500000000000000h - NAND Write Enable**
The write-enable bit in the status register is set.
Only works in RW access mode.

**8B00000000000000h - NAND Select ROM access mode**
Switch to ROM access mode.

**B2aaaaaaaa000000h - NAND Select 128Kbyte RW access mode**
The provided address defines an accessible 128K window in RW address
space, reads and writes may only take place within that window, the
lower 17 bits of the address are ignored.
Addresses below start of RW area are ignored (the cart stays in ROM
mode, and the cart does then reportedly get stuck permanently busy).
Addresses that go past the end of the RW address space will just read
all FF\'s.

- **B7aaaaaaaa000000h - NAND Read from ROM or RW area + Data\[200h\]**
This command is used for reading data under both ROM and RW modes.
In ROM mode: returns data from the ROM space, pretty much like the
\'regular\' B7 command, trying to read from RW space in this mode wil
return all FF\'s.
In RW mode: returns data from the RW space, the provided address needs
to be within the access window specified by command B2h.

- **D600000000000000h - NAND Read Status + Data\[4\]**
Status register bits:

```

For Jam with Band, the 16 bytes at 018h are also found in the last 800h
bytes of the RW space (see below). The bytes with value ECh might be
related to the Maker ID in Chip ID.

**Last 128Kbyte in RW region (at 079E0000h..079FFFFFh)**
The last 128Kbyte of RW area is normal write-able memory in Face
Training without special content. However, in Jam with the Band, the
last 128KByte are readonly, they can be read like normal RW blocks
(select via command B2h, then read via B7h), but writing isn\'
supported (although NAND Status bit5 gets cleared for a moment upon
write attempts to this 128Kbyte area; unlike as for when trying to write
7A00000h and up).

Jam with the Band checks the bytes at 079FF800h (unknown what it does
with them, or what it does when they are missing).

**Reserved Area (at 07A00000h and up) (including 08000000h and up)**
This memory isn\'t intended to be used, in Jam with the Band it jus
returns FFh\'s. However, in Face Training it does return som
interesting internal data (in RW mode):
The DSi Blowfish key (with the gamecode pre-applied), some NDS ARM code
(for the secure area or so), and most interestingly some more ARM+THUMB
code (apparently containing the firmware running on an ARM CPU inside of
the game cartridge itself).
Unfortunately, that internal memory is returned as \"raw\" data wit
faulty bits, and it seems to be required to apply error correction to
convert it to actual intact data (the \"raw\" stuff consists o
1E8h-byte data snippets, usually followed by 8-byte ECC info, or
sometimes 16-byte or 20-byte ECC, or no ECC at all). There are several
\"backup\" copies of the blowfish/firmware blocks.

|       (this chip must be slightly different, for DSi mode support)    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

There are also a bunch of 3DS games with similar chips (with the RW area
being called \"CARD2\" area on 3DS, and, the 3DS is using 16-byt
commands, so the protocol is different).

**Notes**
Unlike ROM carts, the NAND cart does crash upon invalid commands (and
stops to respond to further commands). That is, upon invalid command
numbers, upon ROM mode commands in RW mode (or vice-versa), upon any
data lengths other than listed above.
