# GBA Cart Backup SRAM/FRAM


SRAM - 32 KBytes (256Kbit) Lifetime: Depends on back-up battery
FRAM - 32 KBytes (256Kbit) Lifetime: 10,000,000,000 read/write per bit

Hyundai GM76V256CLLFW10 SRAM (Static RAM) (eg. F-Zero)
Fujitsu MB85R256 FRAM (Ferroelectric RAM) (eg. Warioware Twisted)

**Addressing and Waitstates**
SRAM/FRAM is mapped to E000000h-E007FFFh, it should be accessed with 8
waitstates (write a value of 3 into Bit0-1 of WAITCNT).

**Databus Width**
The SRAM/FRAM databus is restricted to 8 bits, it should be accessed by
LDRB, LDRSB, and STRB opcodes only.

**Reading and Writing**
Reading from SRAM/FRAM should be performed by code executed in WRAM only
(but not by code executed in ROM). There is no such restriction for
writing.

**Preventing Data Loss**
The GBA SRAM/FRAM carts do not include a write-protect function (unlike
older 8bit gameboy carts). This seems to be a problem and may cause data
loss when a cartridge is removed or inserted while the GBA is still
turned on. As far as I understand, this is not so much a hardware
problem, but rather a software problem, ie. theoretically you could
remove/insert the cartridge as many times as you want, but you should
take care that your program does not crash (and write blindly into
memory).

**Recommended Workaround**
Enable the Gamepak Interrupt (it\'ll most likely get triggered whe
removing the cartridge), and hang-up the GBA in an endless loop when
your interrupt handler senses a Gamepak IRQ. For obvious reason, your
interrupt handler should be located in WRAM, ie. not in the (removed)
ROM cartridge. The handler should process Gamepak IRQs at highest
priority. Periods during which interrupts are disabled should be kept as
short as possible, if necessary allow nested interrupts.

**When to use the above Workaround**
A program that relies wholly on code and data in WRAM, and that does not
crash even when ROM is removed, may keep operating without having to use
the above mechanism.
Do NOT use the workaround for programs that run without a cartridge
inserted (ie. single gamepak/multiboot slaves), or for programs that use
Gamepak IRQ/DMA for other purposes.
All other programs should use it. It\'d be eventually a good idea t
include it even in programs that do not use SRAM/FRAM themselves (eg.
otherwise removing a SRAM/FRAM-less cartridge may lock up the GBA, and
may cause it to destroy backup data when inserting a SRAM/FRAM
cartridge).

**SRAM vs FRAM**
FRAM (Ferroelectric RAM) is a newer technology, used in newer GBA carts,
unlike SRAM (Static RAM), it doesn\'t require a battery to hold th
data. At software side, it is accessed exactly like SRAM, ie. unlike
EEPROM/FLASH, it doesn\'t require any Write/Erase commands/delays.

**Note**
In SRAM/FRAM cartridges, the /REQ pin (Pin 31 of Gamepak bus) should be
a little bit shorter as than the other pins; when removing the
cartridge, this causes the gamepak IRQ signal to get triggered before
the other pins are disconnected.
