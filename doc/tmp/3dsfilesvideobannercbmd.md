# 3DS Files - Video Banner (CBMD)


CBMD - CTR Banner Model Data (archive for CGFX/CWAV files)
These are stored in CXI ExeFS:/banner and optionally in extdata
exbanner.
This is used for banners of titles you see in the home menu.
BNR used for the app banners in the CXI/exbanner is the same as CBMD
with CWAV at the end (uh, who is \"BNR\", and is that CWAV alway
supported in all cases, or only for that \"BNR\" thing?).

\"The common CGFX is used if the CGFX offset for the syste
region/language is zero. Those optional offsets can be used in extdata
exbanner, but separate CBMD banner files for each region/language can be
used as well.\"

**Entry Size**
The header contains only offsets. To compute the size, search the next
bigger offset (or use the filesize as max offset), and then subtract the
current offset from that value. Note: The list does usually contain
increasing offsets (but it may be a bad idea to rely on that, eg.
EUR-Spanish and USA-Spanish might use the same offsets).

**CGFX Graphics**
- [3DS Files - Video Archive (./3dsfilesvideoarchivecgfx.md)
Banner CGFX files are LZ11-compressed, the decompressed CGFX size
shouldn\'t exceed 80000h bytes for banners.

**CWAV Sound**
- [3DS Files - Sound Wave Data (CWAVFormat)](./3dsfilessoundwavedatacwavformat.md)
Banner CWAV total channels must be 2, and the length of the audio must
be 3 seconds or less (uh, is that regardless of sample rate/sample
size?), otherwise the sound will play incorrectly (beeping/clicking) or
the model may fail to load.
