# DSi Exploits


DSi executables require RSA signatures (signed with Nintendo\'s private key), which is making it impossible to run any unlicensed/homebrew code, except via exploits (eg. modified .sav data for tweaking licensed games into booting unlicensed code).

### Unlaunch.dsi - first ever released DSi bootcode exploit
This exploit allows to get control of the DSi almost immediately after power-up with full SCFG_EXT access rights. That\'s making it the best possible exploit for any purpose.
It can be installed via any DSiware exploits (eg. Flipnote), or via hardmod.

### Ready for use DSiware Exploits (crashing system titles from SD card)
There are two exploitable titles that can be exploited via simple SD card files (without needing hardmod or downgrading): DSi Camera and Flipnote
### DSi Camera (aka Memory Pit exploit):
The DSI Camera is installed in all regions, and people can\'t install it, so this exploit should work for everyone. The original Memory Pit exploit (from shutterbug2000) worked only on unspecified firmwares, but there is newer Memory Pit (from zoogie) the works in all regions and firmware versions.
Usage: Replace the SD:\\private\\ds\\app\\484E494A\\pit.bin file, then go to Camera SD Card Album.
### Flipnote:
Flipnote exists for US+EUR+AUS+JAP regions (not CHN or KOR), and it has been available for free (either pre-installed, or free download from DSi shop), so many people should have that title (though, surprisingly, quite some people don\'t have it because they had never downloaded it for free when the DSi shop was still online; and some might have deleted it).
Anyways, if you have flipnote: Use the \"Flipnote Lenny (or whatever it is called)\" exploit, working for all four flipnote regions (US+EUR+AUS+JAP), the download URL seems to be this weird link:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       https://davejmurphy.com/%25CD%25A1-%25CD%259C%25CA%2596-%25CD%25A1/ |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

downloading seems to require buying a newer PC, and a browser with strong https support and youtube playing capabilities for watching the installation guide (unless the download contains instructions in regular .txt format).

### Other DSiware Exploits (DSi shop downloads crashed with .sav files)
Installing DSiware exploits requires downgrading the firmware (and in case of sudoku: also downgrading the game). Downgrading can be done by soldering a few wires to the eMMC chip and then using utilities like \"TWLTool\". Most recommended title would be Sudoku (it\'s cheapest and doesn\'t require any menu navigation; apart from getting through a \"touch to start\" screen).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Region       Price Title                                                    |
|       US,EU/AU     $2    Sudoku (Electronic Arts)   (updated version in DSi shop) |
|       US,EU/AU     $5    Fieldrunners        (original version still in DSi shop) |
|       US,EU/AU     $5    Guitar Rock Tour ("grtpwn")      (no longer in DSi shop) |
|       US,EU/AU,JP  $8    Legends of Exidia   (original version still in DSi shop) |
|       US,...?      Free  Zelda 4 Swords                   (no longer in DSi shop) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Once when the game+exploit are installed, the exploits will boot a file called \"boot.nds\" from SD card (eg. rename dslink to that name for wifi boot).
The DSi shop closed in 2017, so one can no longer legally buy DSiware. One could install pirate copies with tweaked .tik files for exploitable games, but it would be pointless (doing so would require a hardmod, and if you have a hardmod, then you could as well install unlaunch directly).
Note: Originally, dsiwarehax were installed via SD card without soldering, but that works only when having downloaded the exploitable games prior to release of firmware 1.4.2.
As of 2017, the DSi shop is closing (one cannot add new DSi points to the shop account, but can still use old DSi points that are already on the account for a few months).
Note: Buying DSiware was quite expensive (ie. buying a \$15 wii/dsi point card worked, but you couldn\'t resell or reuse the remaining dsi points on other consoles).

### DSi Cartridge Exploits
Exploitable DSi cartridges have been mass-produced as gifts for fat, senile or unhealthy family members, and naturally most people will be glad to get rid of such games for less than \$5 (including shipping).

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Biggest Loser (US,EU) (works with firmware 1.4.5) (=on all DSi's, as of 2015) |
|       Cooking Coach (US,EU) (blocked in firmware 1.4.4 and up)                      |
|       Classic Word Games (US,EU) (blocked in firmware 1.4.4 and up) (uncomfortable) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The cartridge contain rather small EEPROMs, barely enough to boot actual code via wifi. Wintermute\'s \"dslink\" utility is solving EEPROM size limits by storing extra boot code in the Wifi FLASH memory on DWM-W015 daughterboard (later DSi\'s with DWM-W024 daughterboards have small Wifi FLASH; workarounds would be to install a bigger FLASH chip in the daughterboard, or to try to squeeze the whole bootcode into the cartridge EEPROM). The different cartridges, and their localized titles are:
Biggest Loser (fitness game for fat people with dead animal food):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       TWL-VBLV-EUU  Biggest Loser USA (UK)  ;(European title has "USA" suffix)    |
|       TWL-VBLE-USA  Biggest Loser (US)      ;(US title doesn't have "USA" suffix) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Cooking Coach (make healthy food with dead animals):

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       TWL-VCKE-USA  My Healthy Cooking Coach (US)                             |
|       TWL-VCKV-UKV  My Cooking Coach - Prepare Healthy Recipes (UK)           |
|       TWL-VCKS-SPA  Mi Experto en Cocina - Comida Saludable (ES)              |
|       TWL-VCKF-FRA  Mon Coach Personnel - Mes Recettes Plaisir et Ligne (FR)  |
|       TWL-VCKI-ITA  Il Mio Coach di Cucina - Prepara Cibi Sani e Gustosi (IT) |
|       TWL-VCKD-NOE  Mein Koch-Coach - Gesund und Lecker Kochen (DE)           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Classic Word Games (crossword game) (more expensive, and less comfortable to use than Cooking Coach and Biggest Loser):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       TWL-VCWE-USA Classic Word Games (US)                            |
|       TWL-VCWV-UKV Classic Word Games (UK/EU)                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The UK, ES, FR, IT, DE versions are working on all european consoles.

### DSi Exploit Restrictions (for anything except Unlaunch exploit)
Exploits (except Unlaunch) are booted with some hardware features disabled:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ARM7 cannot access to SCFG/MBK configuration and Console ID registers |
|       For DSiware Exploits: Cannot access DS Cartridge slot                 |
|       For Cartridge Exploits: Cannot access SD/MMC registers                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Initial memory content and register settings may be changed by the exploited game (and/or by the exploit\'s boot code), so the DSi won\'t be in the same state as when booting real licensed games.

### Whitelist exploit (unreleased)
Rocketlauncher was supposed to get full control over the DSi via buffer overflows during NDS cart whitelist checks (via invalid Offset+Length values in the \"NDHI\" section of the Whitelist file, matched to the currently inserted NDS cartridge).
Unfortunately, that exploit was never finished/released - and, as by now, Unlaunch.dsi can do the same thing (even earlier after power-up, working with all retail firmware versions/regions, and without needing a NDS cart to trigger the whitelist check).

### DSi Flashcarts
The majority of DSi Flashcarts are \"DSi compatible\", which does barely mean that they can boot DS games on DSi consoles in DS mode (but cannot run DSi software in DSi mode). The only flashcart with \"DSi mode\" support is/was CycloDS iEvolution (based on Cooking Coach exploit, without support for newer firmwares).
Essentially, flashcarts aren\'t of too much use: Booting from built-in SD Card slot would also work without flashcarts, and Wifi boot would be more comfortable anyways.
