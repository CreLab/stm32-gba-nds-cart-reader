# DSi Exploits


DSi executables require RSA signatures (signed with Nintendo\'s privat
key), which is making it impossible to run any unlicensed/homebrew code,
except via exploits (eg. modified .sav data for tweaking licensed games
into booting unlicensed code).

**Unlaunch.dsi - first ever released DSi bootcode exploit**
This exploit allows to get control of the DSi almost immediately after
power-up with full SCFG_EXT access rights. That\'s making it the bes
possible exploit for any purpose.
It can be installed via any DSiware exploits (eg. Flipnote), or via
hardmod.

**Ready for use DSiware Exploits (crashing system titles from SD
card)**
There are two exploitable titles that can be exploited via simple SD
card files (without needing hardmod or downgrading): DSi Camera and
Flipnote
**DSi Camera (aka Memory Pit exploit):**
The DSI Camera is installed in all regions, and people can\'t instal
it, so this exploit should work for everyone. The original Memory Pit
exploit (from shutterbug2000) worked only on unspecified firmwares, but
there is newer Memory Pit (from zoogie) the works in all regions and
firmware versions.
Usage: Replace the SD:\\private\\ds\\app\\484E494A\\pit.bin file, the
go to Camera SD Card Album.
**Flipnote:**
Flipnote exists for US+EUR+AUS+JAP regions (not CHN or KOR), and it has
been available for free (either pre-installed, or free download from DSi
shop), so many people should have that title (though, surprisingly,
quite some people don\'t have it because they had never downloaded i
for free when the DSi shop was still online; and some might have deleted
it).
Anyways, if you have flipnote: Use the \"Flipnote Lenny (or whatever i
is called)\" exploit, working for all four flipnote region
(US+EUR+AUS+JAP), the download URL seems to be this weird link:

|   https://davejmurphy.com/%25CD%25A1-%25CD%259C%25CA%2596-%25CD%25A1/ |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

downloading seems to require buying a newer PC, and a browser with
strong https support and youtube playing capabilities for watching the
installation guide (unless the download contains instructions in regular
.txt format).

**Other DSiware Exploits (DSi shop downloads crashed with .sav files)**
Installing DSiware exploits requires downgrading the firmware (and in
case of sudoku: also downgrading the game). Downgrading can be done by
soldering a few wires to the eMMC chip and then using utilities like
\"TWLTool\". Most recommended title would be Sudoku (it\'s cheapest an
doesn\'t require any menu navigation; apart from getting through 
\"touch to start\" screen).

Once when the game+exploit are installed, the exploits will boot a file
called \"boot.nds\" from SD card (eg. rename dslink to that name fo
wifi boot).
The DSi shop closed in 2017, so one can no longer legally buy DSiware.
One could install pirate copies with tweaked .tik files for exploitable
games, but it would be pointless (doing so would require a hardmod, and
if you have a hardmod, then you could as well install unlaunch
directly).
Note: Originally, dsiwarehax were installed via SD card without
soldering, but that works only when having downloaded the exploitable
games prior to release of firmware 1.4.2.
As of 2017, the DSi shop is closing (one cannot add new DSi points to
the shop account, but can still use old DSi points that are already on
the account for a few months).
Note: Buying DSiware was quite expensive (ie. buying a \$15 wii/ds
point card worked, but you couldn\'t resell or reuse the remaining ds
points on other consoles).

**DSi Cartridge Exploits**
Exploitable DSi cartridges have been mass-produced as gifts for fat,
senile or unhealthy family members, and naturally most people will be
glad to get rid of such games for less than \$5 (including shipping).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Biggest                                                         |
| Loser (US,EU) (works with firmware 1.4.5) (=on all DSi's, as of 2015) |
|       Cooking Coach (US,EU) (blocked in firmware 1.4.4 and up)        |
|       Classic                                                         |
| Word Games (US,EU) (blocked in firmware 1.4.4 and up) (uncomfortable) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The cartridge contain rather small EEPROMs, barely enough to boot actual
code via wifi. Wintermute\'s \"dslink\" utility is solving EEPROM siz
limits by storing extra boot code in the Wifi FLASH memory on DWM-W015
daughterboard (later DSi\'s with DWM-W024 daughterboards have small Wif
FLASH; workarounds would be to install a bigger FLASH chip in the
daughterboard, or to try to squeeze the whole bootcode into the
cartridge EEPROM). The different cartridges, and their localized titles
are:
Biggest Loser (fitness game for fat people with dead animal food):

```

|       TWL                                                             |
| -VBLV-EUU  Biggest Loser USA (UK)  ;(European title has "USA" suffix) |

| LE-USA  Biggest Loser (US)      ;(US title doesn't have "USA" suffix) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Cooking Coach (make healthy food with dead animals):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       TWL-VCKE-USA  My Healthy Cooking Coach (US)                     |
|       TWL-VCKV-UKV  My Cooking Coach - Prepare Healthy Recipes (UK)   |

|       T                                                               |
| WL-VCKF-FRA  Mon Coach Personnel - Mes Recettes Plaisir et Ligne (FR) |
|       TW                                                              |

|       TWL-VCKD-NOE  Mein Koch-Coach - Gesund und Lecker Kochen (DE)   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Classic Word Games (crossword game) (more expensive, and less
comfortable to use than Cooking Coach and Biggest Loser):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       TWL-VCWE-USA Classic Word Games (US)                            |
|       TWL-VCWV-UKV Classic Word Games (UK/EU)                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The UK, ES, FR, IT, DE versions are working on all european consoles.

**DSi Exploit Restrictions (for anything except Unlaunch exploit)**
Exploits (except Unlaunch) are booted with some hardware features
disabled:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
| ARM7 cannot access to SCFG/MBK configuration and Console ID registers |
|       For DSiware Exploits: Cannot access DS Cartridge slot           |
|       For Cartridge Exploits: Cannot access SD/MMC registers          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Initial memory content and register settings may be changed by the
exploited game (and/or by the exploit\'s boot code), so the DSi won\'
be in the same state as when booting real licensed games.

**Whitelist exploit (unreleased)**
Rocketlauncher was supposed to get full control over the DSi via buffer
overflows during NDS cart whitelist checks (via invalid Offset+Length
values in the \"NDHI\" section of the Whitelist file, matched to th
currently inserted NDS cartridge).
Unfortunately, that exploit was never finished/released - and, as by
now, Unlaunch.dsi can do the same thing (even earlier after power-up,
working with all retail firmware versions/regions, and without needing a
NDS cart to trigger the whitelist check).

**DSi Flashcarts**
The majority of DSi Flashcarts are \"DSi compatible\", which does barel
mean that they can boot DS games on DSi consoles in DS mode (but cannot
run DSi software in DSi mode). The only flashcart with \"DSi mode\
support is/was CycloDS iEvolution (based on Cooking Coach exploit,
without support for newer firmwares).
Essentially, flashcarts aren\'t of too much use: Booting from built-i
SD Card slot would also work without flashcarts, and Wifi boot would be
more comfortable anyways.
