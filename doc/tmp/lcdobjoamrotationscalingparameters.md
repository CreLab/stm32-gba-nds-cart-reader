# LCD OBJ - OAM Rotation/Scaling Parameters


As described in the previous chapter, there are blank spaces between
each of the 128 OBJ Attribute Fields in OAM memory. These 128 16bit gaps
are used to store OBJ Rotation/Scaling Parameters.

**Location of Rotation/Scaling Parameters in OAM**
Four 16bit parameters (PA,PB,PC,PD) are required to define a complete
group of Rotation/Scaling data. These are spread across OAM as such:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       1st Group - PA=07000006, PB=0700000E, PC=07000016, PD=0700001E  |
|       2nd Group - PA=07000026, PB=0700002E, PC=07000036, PD=0700003E  |
|       etc.                                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

By using all blank space (128 x 16bit), up to 32 of these groups (4 x
16bit each) can be defined in OAM.

**OBJ Rotation/Scaling PA,PB,PC,PD Parameters (R/W)**
Each OBJ that uses Rotation/Scaling may select between any of the above
32 parameter groups. For details, refer to the previous chapter about
OBJ Attributes.
The meaning of the separate PA,PB,PC,PD values is identical as for BG,
for details read the chapter about BG Rotation/Scaling.

**OBJ Reference Point & Rotation Center**
The OBJ Reference Point is the upper left of the OBJ, ie. OBJ X/Y
coordinates: X+0, Y+0.
The OBJ Rotation Center is always (or should be usually?) in the middle
of the object, ie. for a 8x32 pixel OBJ, this would be at the OBJ X/Y
coordinates: X+4, and Y+16.

**OBJ Double-Size Bit (for OBJs that use Rotation/Scaling)**
When Double-Size is zero: The sprite is rotated, and then display inside
of the normal-sized (not rotated) rectangular area - the edges of the
rotated sprite will become invisible if they reach outside of that
area.
When Double-Size is set: The sprite is rotated, and then display inside
of the double-sized (not rotated) rectangular area - this ensures that
the edges of the rotated sprite remain visible even if they would reach
outside of the normal-sized area. (Except that, for example, rotating a
8x32 pixel sprite by 90 degrees would still cut off parts of the sprite
as the double-size area isn\'t large enough.)
