# GBA Cart Backup IDs


Nintendo didn\'t include a backup-type entry in the ROM header, however, the required type can be detected by ID strings in the ROM-image. Nintendo\'s tools are automatically inserting these strings (as part of their library headers). When using other tools, you may insert ID strings by hand.

### ID Strings
The ID string must be located at a word-aligned memory location, the string length should be a multiple of 4 bytes (padded with zero\'s).

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       EEPROM_Vnnn    EEPROM 512 bytes or 8 Kbytes (4Kbit or 64Kbit)     |
|       SRAM_Vnnn      SRAM 32 Kbytes (256Kbit)                           |
|       FLASH_Vnnn     FLASH 64 Kbytes (512Kbit) (ID used in older files) |
|       FLASH512_Vnnn  FLASH 64 Kbytes (512Kbit) (ID used in newer files) |
|       FLASH1M_Vnnn   FLASH 128 Kbytes (1Mbit)                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For Nintendo\'s tools, \"nnn\" is a 3-digit library version number. When using other tools, best keep it set to \"nnn\" rather than inserting numeric digits.

### Notes
No\$gba does auto-detect most backup types, even without ID strings, except for 128K FLASH (without ID \"FLASH1M_Vnnn\", the FLASH size defaults to 64K). Ideally, for faster detection, the ID should be put into the first some bytes of the ROM-image (ie. somewhere right after the ROM header).
