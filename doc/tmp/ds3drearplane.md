# DS 3D Rear-Plane


Other docs seem to refer to this as Clear-plane, rather than Rear-plane,
anyways, the plane can be an image, so it isn\'t always \"cleared\".
The view order is as such:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       --> 2D L                                                        |
| ayers --> 3D Polygons --> 3D Rear-plane --> 2D Layers --> 2D Backdrop |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The rear-plane can be disabled (by making it transparent; alpha=0), so
that the 2D layers become visible as background.
2D layers can be moved in front of, or behind the 3D layer-group (which
is represented as BG0 to the 2D Engine), 2D layers behind BG0 can be
used instead of, or additionally to the rear-plane.

The rear-plane can be initialized via below two registers (so all pixels
in the plane have the same colors and attributes), this method is used
when DISP3DCNT.14 is zero:

**4000350h - CLEAR_COLOR - Clear Color Attribute Register (W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-4    Clear Color, Red                                         |
|       5-9    Clear Color, Green                                       |
|       10-14  Clear Color, Blue                                        |
|       15                                                              |
|  Fog (enables Fog to the rear-plane) (doesn't affect Fog of polygons) |
|       16-20  Alpha                                                    |
|       21-23  Not used                                                 |
|                                                                       |
|  24-29  Clear Polygon ID (affects edge-marking, at the screen-edges?) |
|       30-31  Not used                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**4000354h - CLEAR_DEPTH - Clear Depth Register (W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-14   Clear Depth (0..7FFFh) (usually 7FFFh = most distant)    |
|       15     Not used                                                 |
|       16-31  See Port 4000356h, CLRIMAGE_OFFSET                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The 15bit Depth is expanded to 24bit as
\"X=(X\*200h)+((X+1)/8000h)\*1FFh\".

**Rear Color/Depth Bitmaps**
Alternately, the rear-plane can be initialized by bitmap data (allowing
to assign different colors & attributes to each pixel), this method is
used when DISP3DCNT.14 is set:
Consists of two bitmaps (one with color data, one with depth data), each
containing 256x256 16bit entries, and so, each occupying a whole 128K
slot,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Rear Color Bitmap (located in Texture Slot 2)                   |
|         0-4    Clear Color, Red                                       |
|         5-9    Clear Color, Green                                     |
|         10-14  Clear Color, Blue                                      |
|         15                                                            |
|    Alpha (0=Transparent, 1=Solid) (equivalent to 5bit-alpha 0 and 31) |
|       Rear Depth Bitmap (located in Texture Slot 3)                   |
|         0                                                             |
| -14   Clear Depth, expanded to 24bit as X=(X*200h)+((X+1)/8000h)*1FFh |
|         15     Clear Fog (Initial fog enable value)                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This method requires VRAM to be allocated to Texture Slot 2 and 3 (see
Memory Control chapter). Of course, in that case the VRAM is used as
Rear-plane, and cannot be used for Textures.
The bitmap method is restricted to 1bit alpha values (the
register-method allows to use a 5bit alpha value).
The Clear Polygon ID is kept defined in the CLEAR_COLOR register, even
in bitmap mode.

**4000356h - CLRIMAGE_OFFSET - Rear-plane Bitmap Scroll Offsets (W)**
The visible portion of the bitmap is 256x192 pixels (regardless of the
viewport setting, which is used only for polygon clipping). Internally,
the bitmap is 256x256 pixels, so the bottom-most 64 rows are usually
offscreen, unless scrolling is used to move them into view.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit0-7   X-Offset (0..255; 0=upper row of bitmap)               |
|       Bit8-14  Y-Offset (0..255; 0=left column of bitmap)             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The bitmap wraps to the upper/left edges when exceeding the lower/right
edges.
