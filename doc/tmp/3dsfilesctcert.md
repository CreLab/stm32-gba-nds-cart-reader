# 3DS Files - CTCert


Below seems to describe \"CTCert\".
Uh, unknown if/where this \"CTCert\" is stored?
Maybe it exists only after having connected to the shop at least once (similar to DSi\'s dev.kp)?
Or maybe it\'s a slightly reformatted copy of the Decrypted OTP, maybe only temporarily stored in RAM?
Or maybe below does describe .ctx file format rather than CTCert format?

The console-unique CTCert is used for signing CTX files (uh, really signing them? with a public key??), the DeviceCert used by eShop, and for DSiWare Exports. This ECDSA signature, the ECDSA private key for this cert, and the IssuerID is loaded from memory initialized by bootrom instead of NAND. This is the 3DS equivalent of the DSi TWCert (aka the \"TW cert\" in DSi \"Tad\" files?).

The CTCert is signed with ECDSA by Nintendo. CTCerts can be verified via a DER stored in NATIVE_FIRM, separate DERs are used for retail and dev/debug.

The ECDSA public key for this cert is converted from the ECDSA private key initialized by bootrom (uh, that\'s probably meant to be from Decrypted OTP). The curve used for ECDSA is sect233r1.
