# 3DS Files - CTCert


Below seems to describe \"CTCert\".
Uh, unknown if/where this \"CTCert\" is stored?
Maybe it exists only after having connected to the shop at least once
(similar to DSi\'s dev.kp)?
Or maybe it\'s a slightly reformatted copy of the Decrypted OTP, mayb
only temporarily stored in RAM?
Or maybe below does describe .ctx file format rather than CTCert
format?

The console-unique CTCert is used for signing CTX files (uh, really
signing them? with a public key??), the DeviceCert used by eShop, and
for DSiWare Exports. This ECDSA signature, the ECDSA private key for
this cert, and the IssuerID is loaded from memory initialized by bootrom
instead of NAND. This is the 3DS equivalent of the DSi TWCert (aka the
\"TW cert\" in DSi \"Tad\" files?).

The CTCert is signed with ECDSA by Nintendo. CTCerts can be verified via
a DER stored in NATIVE_FIRM, separate DERs are used for retail and
dev/debug.

The ECDSA public key for this cert is converted from the ECDSA private
key initialized by bootrom (uh, that\'s probably meant to be fro
Decrypted OTP). The curve used for ECDSA is sect233r1.
