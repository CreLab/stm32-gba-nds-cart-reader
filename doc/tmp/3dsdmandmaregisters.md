# 3DS DMA - NDMA Registers


### NDMA (ARM9 only)
10002000h ARM9
Same as DSi, except, there seem to be 8 channels (instead of 4).
- [DSi New DMA (NDMA)](./dsinewdmandma.md)
And with new bit in NDMAGCNT register:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0        SAD/DAD/TCNT/WCNT register read (0=Written value, 1=Current value) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

And with new bits in NDMAxCNT registers:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-4      New extra startup mode bits (used if startup=0Fh)        |
|       5-9      Unknown (unused on DSi, seem to be always 0 on 3DS, too) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

And with changed startup modes:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h      TIMER0                                       (Port 10003000h) |
|       01h      TIMER1                                       (Port 10003004h) |
|       02h      TIMER2                                       (Port 10003008h) |
|       03h      TIMER3                                       (Port 1000300Ch) |
|       04h      CTRCARD0                                    (maybe 10004000h) |
|       05h      CTRCARD1                                    (maybe 10005000h) |
|       06h      SDMMC controller (eMMC and SD/MMC slot)      (Port 10006000h) |
|       07h      Alternate SD/MMC Slot controller            (maybe 10007000h) |
|       08h      AES IN (WRFIFO)                              (Port 10009008h) |
|       09h      AES OUT (RDFIFO)                             (Port 1000900Ch) |
|       0Ah      SHA IN (WRFIFO)                              (Port 1000A000h) |
|       0Bh      SHA OUT (RDFIFO) (optional readback)         (Port 1000A000h) |
|       0Ch      NTRCARD      (used so by bootrom)           (maybe 10164000h) |
|       0Dh      ?                                                             |
|       0Eh      ?                                                             |
|       0Fh      See below (subclassed)                                        |
|       10h-1Fh  Start immediately (without repeat)                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Mode 0Fh is subclassed by new bits from NDMAxCNT.bit0-4:
