# DS Memory Control - BIOS


**4000308h - NDS7 - BIOSPROT - Bios-data-read-protection address**
Used to double-protect the first some KBytes of the NDS7 BIOS. The BIOS
is split into two protection regions, one always active, one controlled
by the BIOSPROT register. The overall idea is that only the BIOS can
read from itself, any other attempts to read from that regions return
FFh-bytes.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Opcodes at...      Can read from      Expl.                     |
- |       0..[BIOS                                                        |
| PROT]-1    0..3FFFh           Double-protected (when BIOSPROT is set) |
- |       [                                                               |
- | BIOSPROT]..3FFFh  [BIOSPROT]..3FFFh  Normal-protected (always active) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The initial BIOSPROT setting on power-up is zero (disabled). Before
starting the cartridge, the BIOS boot code sets the register to 1204h
(actually 1205h, but the mis-aligned low-bit is ignored). Once when
initialized, further writes to the register are ignored.

The double-protected region contains the exception vectors, some bytes
of code, and the cartridge KEY1 encryption seed (about 4KBytes). As far
as I know, it is impossible to unlock the memory once when it is locked,
however, with some trickery, it is possible execute code before it gets
locked. Also, the two THUMB opcodes at 05ECh can be used to read all
memory at 0..3FFFh,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       05ECh  ldrb r3,[r3,12h]      ;requires incoming r3=src-12h      |
|       05EEh                                                           |
|  pop  r2,r4,r6,r7,r15  ;requires dummy values & THUMB retadr on stack |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Additionally most BIOS functions (eg. CpuSet), include a software-based
protection which rejects source addresses in the BIOS area (the only
exception is GetCRC16, though it still cannot bypass the BIOSPROT
setting).

**Note**
The NDS9 BIOS doesn\'t include any software or hardware based rea
protection.
