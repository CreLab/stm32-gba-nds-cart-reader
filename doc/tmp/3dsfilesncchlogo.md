# 3DS Files - NCCH Logo


The logo was originally stored as file \"logo\" (in the encrypte
ExeFS). Newer files have the logo stored in separate unencrypted data
- block (see NCCH header entries \[130h,198h,19Ch\]). Even in newe
firmwares, the old location in \"logo\" file is still used by Safe Mod
files (at least so on Old3DS). Unknown if the new logo block can also
exist in absence of ExeFS.

\"The Logo contains distribution licensing Binary data (types: Nintendo
Licensed, Published, or Distributed). Additionally it could have no
license (type None). System applications and applets that interact with
the Home Menu are typically set to type \'none\' as they don\'t displa
that information.\"

|       Uh, what means "display that information"?                      |
|       Is there any way to view any logo for any titles... how/where?  |

**Logo Compression**
The logo file is a LZ11 compressed DARC. The compressed data is always
padded to 2000h-byte size.
- [LZ Decompression Functions](./lzdecompressionfunctions.md)
The last 20h bytes of the decompressed data is a SHA256-HMAC hash over
the actual DARC (using a yet unknown HMAC key).

**Logo DARC Archive**
- [3DS Files - Archive DARC](./3dsfilesarchivedarc.md)
The DARC contains three folders and several files (below is from Safe
Mode System Updater):
