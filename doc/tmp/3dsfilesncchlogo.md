# 3DS Files - NCCH Logo


The logo was originally stored as file \"logo\" (in the encrypted ExeFS). Newer files have the logo stored in separate unencrypted data block (see NCCH header entries \[130h,198h,19Ch\]). Even in newer firmwares, the old location in \"logo\" file is still used by Safe Mode files (at least so on Old3DS). Unknown if the new logo block can also exist in absence of ExeFS.

\"The Logo contains distribution licensing Binary data (types: Nintendo, Licensed, Published, or Distributed). Additionally it could have no license (type None). System applications and applets that interact with the Home Menu are typically set to type \'none\' as they don\'t display that information.\"

|       Uh, what means "display that information"?                      |
|       Is there any way to view any logo for any titles... how/where?  |

### Logo Compression
The logo file is a LZ11 compressed DARC. The compressed data is always padded to 2000h-byte size.
- [LZ Decompression Functions](./lzdecompressionfunctions.md)
The last 20h bytes of the decompressed data is a SHA256-HMAC hash over the actual DARC (using a yet unknown HMAC key).

### Logo DARC Archive
- [3DS Files - Archive DARC](./3dsfilesarchivedarc.md)
The DARC contains three folders and several files (below is from Safe Mode System Updater):
