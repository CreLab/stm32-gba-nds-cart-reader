# DS Backwards-compatible GBA-Mode


When booting a 32pin GBA cartridge, the NDS is automatically switched
into GBA mode, in that mode all NDS related features are disabled, and
the console behaves (almost) like a GBA.

**GBA Features that are NOT supported on NDS in GBA Mode.**
Unlike real GBA, the NDS does not support 8bit DMG/CGB cartridges.
The undocumented Internal Memory Control register (Port 800h) isn\'
supported, so the NDS doesn\'t allow to use \'overclocked\' RAM.
The NDS doesn\'t have a link-port, so GBA games can be played only i
single player mode, link-port accessories cannot be used, and the NDS
cannot run GBA code via multiboot.

**GBA Features that are slightly different on NDS in GBA Mode.**
The CPU, Timers, and Sound Frequencies are probably clocked at 16.76MHz;
33.51MHz/2; a bit slower than the original GBA\'s 16.78MHz clock?
In the BIOS, a single byte in a formerly 00h-filled area has been
changed from 00h to 01h, resulting in SWI 0Dh returning a different BIOS
checksum.
The GBA picture can be shown on upper or lower screen (selectable in
boot-menu), the backlight for the selected screen is always on,
resulting in different colors & much better visibility than original
GBA. Unlike GBA-SP, the NDS doesn\'t have a backlight-button.

**Screen Border in GBA mode**
The GBA screen is centered in the middle of the NDS screen. The
surrounding pixels are defined by 32K-color bitmap data in VRAM Block A
and B. Each frame, the GBA picture is captured into one block, and is
displayed in the next frame (while capturing new data to the other
block).
To get a flicker-free border, both blocks should be initialized to
contain the same image before entering GBA mode (usually both are
zero-filled, resulting in a plain black border).
Note: When using two different borders, the flickering will be
irregular - so there appears to be a frame inserted or skipped once
every some seconds in GBA mode?!

|       SWI 1Fh with R2=40h   ;enter GBA mode, by CustomHalt(40h)       |

```

After that, the GBA BIOS will be booted, the GBA Intro will be
displayed, and the GBA cartridge (if any) will be started.
