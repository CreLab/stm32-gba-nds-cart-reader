```

SD Mode Response: R1 (32bit Card Status)
SPI Mode Response: R2 (16bit Card Status) (same as for CMD13, see
there)
Additional Data Transfer (from card):

|       511-0  SSR Register (512bit)                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Send the SD Status. The status fields are given in Table 4-43.

**SD Status (transferred on DATA line after ACMD13)**
The size of the SD Status is one data block of 512 bit. The content of
this register is transmitted to the Host over the DAT bus along with a
16-bit CRC.
ACMD13 can be sent to a card only in \'tran_state\' (card is selected).

```


**Values for SIZE_OF_PROTECTED_AREA**
Setting this field differs between SDSC and SDHC/SDXC.
In case of SDSC Card, the capacity of protected area is calculated as
follows:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Protected Area = SIZE_OF_PROTECTED_AREA_* MULT * BLOCK_LEN.     |
|                                                                       |
|    SIZE_OF_PROTECTED_AREA is specified by the unit in MULT*BLOCK_LEN. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In case of SDHC and SDXC Cards, the capacity of protected area is
calculated as follows:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Protected Area = SIZE_OF_PROTECTED_AREA                         |
|       SIZE_OF_PROTECTED_AREA is specified by the unit in byte.        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Values for SPEED_CLASS**
This 8-bit field indicates the Speed Class. Classes lower than indicated
by this field are also effective.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h      Speed Class 0                                          |
|       01h      Speed Class 2                                          |
|       02h      Speed Class 4                                          |
|       03h      Speed Class 6                                          |
|       04h      Speed Class 10                                         |
|       05h-FFh  Reserved for future/faster classes                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Application Note:
If a Class value indicated in SD Status (including reserved value) is
larger than that of host supported, the host should read as any Class
can be used with the card.
For example, Class 10 is indicated, host should consider Class 2 to 6 is
also effective.

**Values for PERFORMANCE_MOVE**
- This 8-bit field indicates Pm and the value can be set by 1 \[MB/sec\
step.
If the card does not move used RUs, Pm should be considered as
infinity.
Setting to FFh means infinity.
Pm is defined for Class 2 to 6 in Default Speed Mode. When host uses
Class 10, Pm indicated in SD Status shall be ignored and treated as 0.

Maximum AU size (depending on card capacity):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The card can set any AU size (up to above maximum AU size values).
The card should set smaller AU size as much as possible.
Application Notes:
The host should determine host buffer size based on total busy time of
4MB and the card supported class. The host can treat multiple AUs
combined as one unit.

**Values for ERASE_SIZE**
This 16-bit field indicates NERASE. When NERASE numbers of AUs are
erased, the timeout value is specified by ERASE_TIMEOUT (Refer to
ERASE_TIMEOUT).
The host should determine proper number of AUs to be erased in one
operation so that the host can indicate progress of erase operation.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Values for ERASE_TIMEOUT**
This 6-bit field indicates the TERASE and the value indicates erase
timeout from offset when multiple AUs are erased as specified by
ERASE_SIZE. The range of ERASE_TIMEOUT can be defined as up to 63
seconds and the card manufacturer can choose any combination of
ERASE_SIZE and ERASE_TIMEOUT depending on the implementation. Once
ERASE_TIMEOUT is determined, it determines the ERASE_SIZE. The host can
determine timeout for any number of AU erase by the Equation (6). Refer
to 4.14 for the concept of calculating erase timeout. If ERASE_SIZE
field is set to 0, this field shall be set to 0.

**Values for ERASE_OFFSET**
This 2-bit field indicates the TOFFSET and one of four values can be
selected. The erase offset adjusts the line by moving in parallel on the
upper side. Refer to Figure 4-57 and Equation (6) in 4.14. This field is
meaningless if ERASE_SIZE and ERASE_TIMEOUT fields are set to 0.
