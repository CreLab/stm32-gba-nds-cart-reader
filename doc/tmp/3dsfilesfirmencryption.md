# 3DS Files - FIRM Encryption


FIRMs are more or less unencrypted, except that they are stored in
encrypted memory:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - F                                                              |
| IRM bootcode is stored in an encrypted partition (with the usual eMMC |
|                                                                       |
|     encryption; using a different keyslot than FAT partitions though) |
|                                                                       |
| - FIRMs for GBA/DSi/SafeMode are stored in NCCHs files (with the eMMC |
|                                                                       |
- |   filesystem encryption; and usually with NCCH[18Fh].bit2=0, ie. with |
|        further encryption in NCCH ExeFS)                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Apart from that, FIRMs are having a RSA signature (which can be broken
via sighax).

**Self-decrypting New3DS FIRMs**
New3DS FIRMs are containing self-decrypting ARM9 code (there is no
requirement to do that in homebrew FIRMs, it\'s basically a nag feature
making it slightly more difficult to disassemble or patch the official
FIRMs).
The ARM9 block (the FIRM section with the ARM9 entrypoint) looks as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 10h  Encrypted Key_15h_x (same for all FIRM's)             |
|                                                                       |
|    010h 10h  AES-CTR Key Y   ;\for decrypting the code at 800h and up 
|       0                                                               |
| 20h 10h  AES-CTR IV      ;/(these are different in each FIRM version) |
|       030h 8                                                          |

|       038h 8    Padding (FFh-filled)                                  |
|                                                                       |
|  040h 10h  Encrypted zeroes (won't boot if decrypted data is nonzero) |
|       050h 7B                                                         |

|       050h 10h  Some kind of unused debug info              ;\        
|       060h 10                                                         |
| h  Encrypted Key_16h_x                         ; version 9.5.0 and up |

- | 0h ..   Encrypted ARM9-binary (size as from [030h], eg. 546048 bytes) |
|       ...  ..   Code: Unencrypted ARM9 bootstub                       |
|       ...                                                             |

|       ...                                                             |
| 10h  Data: Key_15h_y (for encrypted zeroes)  (eg. 25h,91h,2Ah,C1h,..) |
|                                                                       |
|     ...  4    Data: Entrypoint to decrypted ARM9 code (eg. 08xxxxxxh) |
|       ..                                                              |
| .  1+3  Data: Some flag byte (initially zero, and FFh-filled padding) |
|       ...  ..   Padding to 200h-byte boundary (zerofilled)            |
|       NOT                                                             |
| E: Later FIRMs do reportedly have another Seed value for key 19h-1Fh, |
|       which is probably inserted somewhere(?) in the above data area. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Alongsides with the keys stored at begin & end of the above ARM9 block,
the decryption code use two more sources:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SHA256 computed across first 90h bytes of encrypted OTP memory  |
|       Data read from eMMC address 12C00h (aka eMMC sector number 96h) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Aside from doing the self-decryption, the bootstub does additionally
initialize keyslots 15h, 16h, and 18h..1Fh (some of those are being used
elsewhere).

As shown above, there are three revisions (v8.1 being the original
New3DS firmware, and small changes made in v9.5 and v9.6). The versions
before v9.5 didn\'t actually touch keyslot 16h (the key_16h_x/y value
shown above were written to keyslot 15h). The versions before v9.6 did
produce other keys for keyslot 19h-1Fh (but they were never used, so one
will only need the newer v9.6 values; which require finding a yet
unknown seed value though).

**Terror**
Caution: The FIRM key init description on 3dbrew FIRM page is
incomplete, confusing, irrelevant, and simply mind blowing (the
description won\'t make any sense at all without simultaneously lookin
at the disassembled firmware code; or perhaps looking at above pseudo
code).
