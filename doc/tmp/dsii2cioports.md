# DSi I2C I/O Ports


**4004500h - DSi7 - I2C_DATA (R/W)**

|       0-7  Data (or Device, or Register)                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When sending data, I2C_DATA should be written \<before\> settin
I2C_CNT.bit7.
When reading data, I2C_DATA should be read \<after\> I2C_CNT.bit7 goe
off.
Alongsides with the 8bit data, an additional 1bit \"Ack\" flag i
transferred as response to the data (ie. in opposite direction of data
direction), the Ack is located in I2C_CNT.Bit4, and it\'s usuall
indicating errors (or in some cases it appears to be also used to
indicate that no further data is to be transferred).

**I2C Transfer Flowchart**
The first byte (with the \"Start\" condition) contains the devic
number, which consists of a 7bit chip ID and a direction flag in bit0
(0=Write or 1=Read). The direction flag applies to all following bytes
(until last byte with \"Stop\" condition), that rule means that \"Writ
Index & Write Data\" can be done in a single step, whilst \"Write Inde
& Read Data\" must be split into two separate steps (each with ow
\"Start/Stop\" conditions):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      For Writing:                                                     |
|       Write Device+0 (with Start condition)                 ;\        
|       Write                                                           |
|  Index byte(s)                                   ; write index + data |
|       Write Data byte(s) (last byte with Stop condition)    ;/        |
|      For Reading:                                                     |
|       Write De                                                        |
| vice+0 (with Start condition)                 ;\1st step: write index 
|       Write Index byte(s)                                   ;/        |
|       Write                                                           |
| Device+1 (with Start condition)                 ;\2nd step: read data 
|       Read Data byte(s) (last byte with ACK=0 and Stop)     ;/        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The index is usually a single byte (except for Aptina cameras, which do
use 16bit indices transferred in two bytes; ordered MSB, LSB).
Per-byte transfer completion is indicated by the Start/busy flag, which
should also indicate if the I2C chip is ready for next byte (I2C devices
can hold the clock line low if they aren\'t ready), however, the BPTW
chip somehow doesn\'t support that, and it should be accessed with a
extra delay:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Invoke byte-transfer                                            |
|       Do WaitByLoop (needed for the BPTWL device only)                |
|       Wait for start/busy flag to get zero                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: The DSi firmware is doing eight retries per I2C command (in case
of receiving wrong ACK bytes), unknown if that\'s really required, 
stable system should never need to do retries.
