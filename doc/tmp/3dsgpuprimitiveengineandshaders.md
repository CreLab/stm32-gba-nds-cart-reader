# 3DS GPU Primitive Engine and Shaders


The 3DS seems to have four \"shaders\", each with there own I/O ports
However, the vertex shaders seem to be used in parallel (to process 3 or
4 vertices at once\... so it\'s unknown if one needs to initialize al
sets of I/O ports separately; 3dbrew seems to have only two shaders
documented (GSH and VSH), without even being aware of the VSH2 and VSH3
registers.

**Vertex Shader (VSH)**
The Vertex Shader is used to forward incoming vertex data (coordinates,
colors, texcoords) to the drawing engine. Most commonly, the shader
would be used to multiply the incoming coordinates with a Position
Matrix and/or Projection Matrix.

**Geometry Shader (GSH)**
The Geometry Shader can be used to do something\... but it appears to b
unknown what, and how.
It can probably somehow receive incoming values from somewhere. And
probably output values to somewhere (maybe somehow forwarding them to
other GPU registers, and maybe somehow sending them as response to the
CPU).
The \"EMIT\" opcode might output data from Geometry Shader to Verte
shader?
The \"Primitive Engine\" section below might refer to the geometr
shader?

**Primitive Engine**
Primitive Engine (PE) is one of the PICA200\'s four vertex processo
units and provides some unique features which are used to implement a
geometry shader stage and variable-size primitive rendering.
The full functionality of PE is not yet understood and remains to be
reverse-engineered.
Variable-size primitives are implemented by prefixing each per-primitive
sequence of indices in an index array with a primitive size. This is
used for various effects, for example Catmull-Clark subdivision and Loop
subdivision. It is unknown how this feature is enabled specifically.
