# 3DS ARM9 Timers


**Timers (ARM9 only)**
10003000h ARM9
Same as GBA/NDS/DSi, except, reportedly faster & with stunning
accuracy:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       "timers run at a frequency of 67,027,964.0 +/- 2^(-32) Hz"      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

which would be an estimated error of about +/- 1 cycle per century, or
+/- 1 second per a few billions of years.
