# GBA DMA Transfers


**Overview**
The GBA includes four DMA channels, the highest priority is assigned to
DMA0, followed by DMA1, DMA2, and DMA3. DMA Channels with lower priority
are paused until channels with higher priority have completed.
The CPU is paused when DMA transfers are active, however, the CPU is
operating during the periods when Sound/Blanking DMA transfers are
paused.

**Special features of the separate DMA channels**
DMA0 - highest priority, best for timing critical transfers (eg. HBlank
DMA).
DMA1 and DMA2 - can be used to feed digital sample data to the Sound
FIFOs.
DMA3 - can be used to write to Game Pak ROM/FlashROM (but not GamePak
SRAM).
Aside from that, each DMA 0-3 may be used for whatever general
purposes.

**40000B0h,0B2h - DMA0SAD - DMA 0 Source Address (W) (internal
memory)**
**40000BCh,0BEh - DMA1SAD - DMA 1 Source Address (W) (any memory)**
**40000C8h,0CAh - DMA2SAD - DMA 2 Source Address (W) (any memory)**
**40000D4h,0D6h - DMA3SAD - DMA 3 Source Address (W) (any memory)**
The most significant address bits are ignored, only the least
significant 27 or 28 bits are used (max 07FFFFFFh internal memory, or
max 0FFFFFFFh any memory - except SRAM ?!).

**40000B4h,0B6h - DMA0DAD - DMA 0 Destination Address (W) (internal
memory)**
**40000C0h,0C2h - DMA1DAD - DMA 1 Destination Address (W) (internal
memory)**
**40000CCh,0CEh - DMA2DAD - DMA 2 Destination Address (W) (internal
memory)**
**40000D8h,0DAh - DMA3DAD - DMA 3 Destination Address (W) (any
memory)**
The most significant address bits are ignored, only the least
significant 27 or 28 bits are used (max. 07FFFFFFh internal memory or
0FFFFFFFh any memory - except SRAM ?!).

**40000B8h - DMA0CNT_L - DMA 0 Word Count (W) (14 bit, 1..4000h)**
**40000C4h - DMA1CNT_L - DMA 1 Word Count (W) (14 bit, 1..4000h)**
**40000D0h - DMA2CNT_L - DMA 2 Word Count (W) (14 bit, 1..4000h)**
**40000DCh - DMA3CNT_L - DMA 3 Word Count (W) (16 bit, 1..10000h)**
Specifies the number of data units to be transferred, each unit is 16bit
or 32bit depending on the transfer type, a value of zero is treated as
max length (ie. 4000h, or 10000h for DMA3).

**40000BAh - DMA0CNT_H - DMA 0 Control (R/W)**
**40000C6h - DMA1CNT_H - DMA 1 Control (R/W)**
**40000D2h - DMA2CNT_H - DMA 2 Control (R/W)**
**40000DEh - DMA3CNT_H - DMA 3 Control (R/W)**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

After changing the Enable bit from 0 to 1, wait 2 clock cycles before
accessing any DMA related registers.

When accessing OAM (7000000h) or OBJ VRAM (6010000h) by HBlank Timing,
then the \"H-Blank Interval Free\" bit in DISPCNT register must be set.

**Source and Destination Address and Word Count Registers**
The SAD, DAD, and CNT_L registers are holding the initial start
addresses, and initial length. The hardware does NOT change the content
of these registers during or after the transfer.
The actual transfer takes place by using internal pointer/counter
registers. The initial values are copied into internal regs under the
following circumstances:
Upon DMA Enable (Bit 15) changing from 0 to 1: Reloads SAD, DAD, CNT_L.
Upon Repeat: Reloads CNT_L, and optionally DAD (Increment+Reload).

**DMA Repeat bit**
If the Repeat bit is cleared: The Enable bit is automatically cleared
after the specified number of data units has been transferred.
If the Repeat bit is set: The Enable bit remains set after the transfer,
and the transfer will be restarted each time when the Start condition
(eg. HBlank, Fifo) becomes true. The specified number of data units is
transferred \<each\> time when the transfer is (re-)started. Th
transfer will be repeated forever, until it gets stopped by software.

**Sound DMA (FIFO Timing Mode) (DMA1 and DMA2 only)**
In this mode, the DMA Repeat bit must be set, and the destination
address must be FIFO_A (040000A0h) or FIFO_B (040000A4h).
Upon DMA request from sound controller, 4 units of 32bits (16 bytes) are
transferred (both Word Count register and DMA Transfer Type bit are
ignored). The destination address will not be incremented in FIFO mode.
Keep in mind that DMA channels of higher priority may offhold sound DMA.
For example, when using a 64 kHz sample rate, 16 bytes of sound DMA data
are requested each 0.25ms (4 kHz), at this time another 16 bytes are
still in the FIFO so that there\'s still 0.25ms time to satisfy the DM
request. Thus DMAs with higher priority should not be operated for
longer than 0.25ms. (This problem does not arise for HBlank transfers as
HBlank time is limited to 16.212us.)

**Game Pak DMA**
Only DMA 3 may be used to transfer data to/from Game Pak ROM or Flash
ROM - it cannot access Game Pak SRAM though (as SRAM data bus is limited
to 8bit units). In normal mode, DMA is requested as long until Word
Count becomes zero. When setting the \'Game Pack DRQ\' bit, then th
cartridge must contain an external circuit which outputs a /DREQ signal.
Note that there is only one pin for /DREQ and /IREQ, thus the cartridge
may not supply /IREQs while using DRQ mode.

**Video Capture Mode (DMA3 only)**
Intended to copy a bitmap from memory (or from external hardware/camera)
to VRAM. When using this transfer mode, set the repeat bit, and write
the number of data units (per scanline) to the word count register.
Capture works similar like HBlank DMA, however, the transfer is started
when VCOUNT=2, it is then repeated each scanline, and it gets stopped
when VCOUNT=162.

**Transfer End**
The DMA Enable flag (Bit 15) is automatically cleared upon completion of
the transfer. The user may also clear this bit manually in order to stop
the transfer (obviously this is possible for Sound/Blanking DMAs only,
in all other cases the CPU is stopped until the transfer completes by
itself).

**Transfer Rate/Timing**
Except for the first data unit, all units are transferred by sequential
reads and writes. For n data units, the DMA transfer time is:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       2N+2(n-1)S+xI                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Of which, 1N+(n-1)S are read cycles, and the other 1N+(n-1)S are write
cycles, actual number of cycles depends on the waitstates and bus-width
of the source and destination areas (as described in CPU Instruction
Cycle Times chapter). Internal time for DMA processing is 2I (normally),
or 4I (if both source and destination are in gamepak memory area).

DMA lockup when stopping while starting ???
Capture delayed, Capture Enable=AutoCleared ???
