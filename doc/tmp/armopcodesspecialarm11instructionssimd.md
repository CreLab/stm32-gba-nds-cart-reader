**Select Bytes from 1st/2nd operand, depending on GE flags (SEL)**
Syntax

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SEL{cond} Rd, Rn, Rm                                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Operation
if ConditionPassed(cond) then
- Rd\[7:0\] = if GE\[0\] == 1 then Rn\[7:0\] else Rm\[7:0\]
- Rd\[15:8\] = if GE\[1\] == 1 then Rn\[15:8\] else Rm\[15:8\]
- Rd\[23:16\] = if GE\[2\] == 1 then Rn\[23:16\] else Rm\[23:16\]
- Rd\[31:24\] = if GE\[3\] == 1 then Rn\[31:24\] else Rm\[31:24\]
Usage
Use SEL after instructions such as SADD8, SADD16, SSUB8, SSUB16, UADD8,
UADD16, USUB8, USUB16, SADDSUBX, SSUBADDX, UADDSUBX and USUBADDX, that
set the GE flags. For example, the following sequence of instructions
sets each byte of Rd equal to the unsigned minimum of the corresponding
bytes of Ra and Rb:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       USUB8 Rd, Ra, Rb                                                |
|       SEL Rd, Rb, Ra                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Notes
Specifying R15 for register Rd, Rm, or Rn has UNPREDICTABLE results.

**SMLAD**
SMLAD (Signed Multiply Accumulate Dual) performs two signed 16 x 16-bit
multiplications. It adds the products to a 32-bit accumulate operand.
Optionally, you can exchange the halfwords of the second operand before
performing the arithmetic. This produces top x bottom and bottom x top
multiplication.
This instruction sets the Q flag if the accumulate operation overflows.
Overflow cannot occur during the multiplications.
X Sets the X bit of the instruction to 1, and the multiplications are
bottom x top and top x bottom.
If the X is omitted, sets the X bit to 0, and the multiplications are
bottom x bottom and top x top.
\<Rm\> Specifies the register that contains the first operand.
\<Rs\> Specifies the register that contains the second operand.
\<Rn\> Specifies the register that contains the accumulate operand.

**Pack Halfword, Bottom-Top or Top-Bottom (PKHBT, PKHTB)**
PKHBT (Pack Halfword Bottom Top) combines the bottom (least significant)
halfword of its first operand with the top (most significant) halfword
of its shifted second operand. The shift is a left shift, by any amount
from 0 to 31.
\<Rn\> Specifies the register that contains the first operand
- Bits\[15:0\] of this operand become bits\[15:0\] of the result of th
operation.
\<Rm\> Specifies the register that contains the second operand. This i
- shifted left by the specified amount, then bits\[31:16\] of this operan
- become bits\[31:16\] of the result of the operation.
\<shift_imm\> Specifies the amount by which Rm is to be shifted left
This is a value from 0 to 31.
If the shift specifier is omitted, a left shift by 0 is used.
Operation
if ConditionPassed(cond) then
- Rd\[15:0\] = Rn\[15:0\]
- Rd\[31:16\] = (Rm Logical_Shift_Left shift_imm)\[31:16\]
