SDHC carts use FAT32, which differs in entries 011h, 016h and
024h-059h:

```

**File Allocation Table - FAT and FAT copy(s)**
The following sectors are occupied by the File Allocation Table (FAT),
which contains 12bit, 16bit, or 32bit entries (for FAT12/16/32) for each
cluster:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       (x000)(0)000      unused, free                                  |
|       (x000)(0)001      ???                                           |
|                                                                       |
|     (x000)(0)002...   pointer to next cluster in chain (0)002..(F)FEF |
|       (xFFF)(F)FF0-6    reserved (no part of chain, not free)         |
|       (xFFF)(F)FF7      defect cluster, don't use                     |
|       (xFFF)(F)FF8-F    last cluster of chain                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The \"x\" in MSB of FAT32 entries is reserved (ie. FAT32 is restricte
to 28bit cluster numbers).
Number and size of FATs can be calculated by the information in the boot
sector.
Note on The first two FAT entries:
\"The first cluster of the data area is cluster #2. That leaves th
first two entries of the FAT unused. In the first byte of the first
entry a copy of the media descriptor is stored. The remaining bits of
this entry are 1. In the second entry the end-of-file marker is stored.
The high order two bits of the second entry are sometimes, in the case
of FAT16 and FAT32, used for dirty volume management: high order bit 1:
last shutdown was clean; next highest bit 1: during the previous mount
no disk I/O errors were detected.
(Historically this description has things backwards: DOS 1.0 did not
have a BIOS Parameter Block, and the distinction between single-sided
and double-sided 5.25\" 360K floppies was indicated by the first byte i
the FAT. DOS 2.0 introduced the BPB with media descriptor byte.)\"

**Root directory**
The following sectors are the Root directory, again, size depends on the
info in bootsector (on FAT32 is it\'s a normal cluster chain wit
variable size). Each entry consists of 32 bytes:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00-07                                                           |
|   8    Filename (first byte: 00=free entry, 2E=dir, E5=deleted entry) |
|       08-0A  3    Filename extension                                  |
|       0B     1    Fileattribute                                       |
|                     bit0 read only                                    |
|                     bit1 hidden                                       |
|                     bit2 system                                       |
|                     bit3 volume label                                 |
|                     bit4 subdirectory                                 |
|                     bit5 archive-flag                                 |
|                     bit6 reserved                                     |
|                     bit7 reserved                                     |
|       0C-0D  2    Reserved, or stuff                                  |
|       0E-0F  2    Reserved, or Creation Timestamp                     |
|       10-11  2    Reserved, or Creation Datestamp                     |
|       12-13  2    Reserved, or Last Access Datestamp                  |
|       14-15  2    Reserved, or MSBs of Cluster (for FAT32)            |
|       16-17  2    Last Modify Timestamp: HHHHHMMM, MMMSSSSS           |
|       18-19  2    Last Modify Datestamp: YYYYYYYM, MMMDDDDD           |
|       1A-1B  2    Pointer to first Cluster of file                    |
|       1C-1F  4    Filesize in bytes (always 0 for directories)        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The \'cluster\' entry points to the first used cluster of the file. Th
FAT entry for that cluster points to the next used cluster (if any), the
FAT entry for that cluster points to the next cluster, and so on.

**Long File Names (LFNs)**
Long File Names (LFNs) are occupying multiple continous directory
entries, consisting of a normal short filename entry, preceeded by one
or more LFN prefix entries (with Attribute=0Fh). Each LFN prefix can
hold 13 characters, the total length should not exceed 255 characters.
The name should be terminated by 0000h, and any remaining unused
characters should be padded by FFFFh. The LFN prefix entries are using
the following format:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0                                                               |
| 0h  1  Sequence Number (bit6: last logical, first physical LFN entry, |
|                                                                       |
|        bit5: 0, bit4-0: number 01h..14h (1Fh)) (or E5h=deleted entry) |
|       01h  10 Long Filename characters (five UCS-2 characters)        |
|       0Bh  1  Attributes (always 0Fh for LFN prefix)                  |
|       0Ch  1  Type (always 00h)                                       |
|       0Dh  1  Short Filename Checksum                                 |
|                                                                       |
- | sum=00h, for i=0 to 10, sum = (sum ROR 1) + shortname_char[i], next i |
|       0Eh  12 Long Filename characters (six UCS-2 characters)         |
|       1Ah  2  First cluster (always 0000h)                            |
|       1Ch  4  Long Filename characters (two UCS-2 characters)         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For example, \"File with very long filename.ext\" would be formatted a
so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Entry 1: LFN Prefix (43h) "me.ext", 0000h, 6xFFFFh              |
|       Entry 2: LFN Prefix (02h) "y long filena"                       |
|       Entry 3: LFN Prefix (01h) "File with ver"                       |
|       Entry 4: Normal 8.3 short filename entry "FILEWI~1.EXT"         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Reserved Sectors (if any)**
Usually the number of reserved sectors is zero. If it is non-zero, then
the following sector(s) are reserved (and could be used by the boot
procedure for whatever purposes).

**Data Clusters 0002..nnnn**
Finally all following sectors are data clusters. The first cluster is
called cluster number (000)(0)002, followed by number (000)(0)003,
(000)(0)004, and so on.
