SWP/SWPB supported by ARMv2a and up. SWP/SWPB has been deprecated in
ARMv6, made optional in ARMv7 (with the possibility of disabling it if
still available), and removed in ARMv8.
Swap works properly including if Rm and Rn specify the same register.
R15 may not be used for either Rn,Rd,Rm. (Rn=R15 would be MRS opcode).
Upper bits of Rd are zero-expanded when using Byte quantity. For info
about byte and word data memory addressing, read LDR and STR opcode
description.
Execution Time: 1S+2N+1I. That is, 2N data cycles, 1S code cycle, plus
1I.
