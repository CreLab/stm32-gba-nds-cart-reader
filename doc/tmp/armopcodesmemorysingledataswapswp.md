# ARM Opcodes: Memory: Single Data Swap (SWP)


### Opcode Format

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                    |
|       31-28  Condition                                                |
|       27-23  Must be 00010b for this instruction                      |
|              Opcode (fixed)                                           |
|                SWP{cond}{B} Rd,Rm,[Rn]      ;Rd=[Rn], [Rn]=Rm         |
|       22     B - Byte/Word bit (0=swap 32bit/word, 1=swap 8bit/byte)  |
|       21-20  Must be 00b for this instruction                         |
|       19-16  Rn - Base register                     (R0-R14)          |
|       15-12  Rd - Destination Register              (R0-R14)          |
|       11-4   Must be 00001001b for this instruction                   |
|       3-0    Rm - Source Register                   (R0-R14)          |

SWP/SWPB supported by ARMv2a and up. SWP/SWPB has been deprecated in ARMv6, made optional in ARMv7 (with the possibility of disabling it if still available), and removed in ARMv8.
Swap works properly including if Rm and Rn specify the same register.
R15 may not be used for either Rn,Rd,Rm. (Rn=R15 would be MRS opcode).
Upper bits of Rd are zero-expanded when using Byte quantity. For info about byte and word data memory addressing, read LDR and STR opcode description.
Execution Time: 1S+2N+1I. That is, 2N data cycles, 1S code cycle, plus 1I.
