# GBA GamePak Prefetch


GamePak Prefetch can be enabled in WAITCNT register. When prefetch
buffer is enabled, the GBA attempts to read opcodes from Game Pak ROM
during periods when the CPU is not using the bus (if any). Memory access
is then performed with 0 Waits if the CPU requests data which is already
stored in the buffer. The prefetch buffer stores up to eight 16bit
values.

**GamePak ROM Opcodes**
The prefetch feature works only with \<opcodes\> fetched from GamePa
ROM. Opcodes executed in RAM or BIOS are not affected by the prefetch
feature (even if that opcodes read \<data\> from GamePak ROM).

**Prefetch Enable**
For GamePak ROM opcodes, prefetch may occur in two situations:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       1) o                                                            |
| pcodes with internal cycles (I) which do not change R15, shift/rotate |
|          r                                                            |
| egister-by-register, load opcodes (ldr,ldm,pop,swp), multiply opcodes |
|       2) opcodes that load/store memory (ldr,str,ldm,stm,etc.)        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Prefetch Disable Bug**
When Prefetch is disabled, the Prefetch Disable Bug will occur for all

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
| "Opcodes in GamePak ROM with Internal Cycles which do not change R15" |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

for those opcodes, the bug changes the opcode fetch time from 1S to 1N.
Note: Affected opcodes (with I cycles) are: Shift/rotate
register-by-register opcodes, multiply opcodes, and load opcodes
(ldr,ldm,pop,swp).
