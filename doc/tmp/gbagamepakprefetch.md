# GBA GamePak Prefetch


GamePak Prefetch can be enabled in WAITCNT register. When prefetch buffer is enabled, the GBA attempts to read opcodes from Game Pak ROM during periods when the CPU is not using the bus (if any). Memory access is then performed with 0 Waits if the CPU requests data which is already stored in the buffer. The prefetch buffer stores up to eight 16bit values.

### GamePak ROM Opcodes
The prefetch feature works only with \<opcodes\> fetched from GamePak ROM. Opcodes executed in RAM or BIOS are not affected by the prefetch feature (even if that opcodes read \<data\> from GamePak ROM).

### Prefetch Enable
For GamePak ROM opcodes, prefetch may occur in two situations:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       1) opcodes with internal cycles (I) which do not change R15, shift/rotate |
|          register-by-register, load opcodes (ldr,ldm,pop,swp), multiply opcodes |
|       2) opcodes that load/store memory (ldr,str,ldm,stm,etc.)                  |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Prefetch Disable Bug
When Prefetch is disabled, the Prefetch Disable Bug will occur for all

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       "Opcodes in GamePak ROM with Internal Cycles which do not change R15" |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

for those opcodes, the bug changes the opcode fetch time from 1S to 1N.
Note: Affected opcodes (with I cycles) are: Shift/rotate register-by-register opcodes, multiply opcodes, and load opcodes (ldr,ldm,pop,swp).
