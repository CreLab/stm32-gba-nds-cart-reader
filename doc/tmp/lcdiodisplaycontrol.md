BG Modes 0-2 are Tile/Map-based. BG Modes 3-5 are Bitmap-based, in these
modes 1 or 2 Frames (ie. bitmaps, or \'full screen tiles\') exists, i
two frames exist, either one can be displayed, and the other one can be
redrawn in background.

**Blanking Bits**
Setting Forced Blank (Bit 7) causes the video controller to display
white lines, and all VRAM, Palette RAM, and OAM may be accessed.
\"When the internal HV synchronous counter cancels a forced blank durin
a display period, the display begins from the beginning, following the
display of two vertical lines.\" What ?
Setting H-Blank Interval Free (Bit 5) allows to access OAM during
H-Blank time - using this feature reduces the number of sprites that can
be displayed per line.

**Display Enable Bits**
By default, BG0-3 and OBJ Display Flags (Bit 8-12) are used to
enable/disable BGs and OBJ. When enabling Window 0 and/or 1 (Bit 13-14),
color special effects may be used, and BG0-3 and OBJ are controlled by
the window(s).

**Frame Selection**
In BG Modes 4 and 5 (Bitmap modes), either one of the two bitmaps/frames
may be displayed (Bit 4), allowing the user to update the other
(invisible) frame in background. In BG Mode 3, only one frame exists.
In BG Modes 0-2 (Tile/Map based modes), a similar effect may be gained
by altering the base address(es) of BG Map and/or BG Character data.

**4000002h - Undocumented - Green Swap (R/W)**
Normally, red green blue intensities for a group of two pixels is output
as BGRbgr (uppercase for left pixel at even xloc, lowercase for right
pixel at odd xloc). When the Green Swap bit is set, each pixel group is
output as BgRbGr (ie. green intensity of each two pixels exchanged).

This feature appears to be applied to the final picture (ie. after
mixing the separate BG and OBJ layers). Eventually intended for other
display types (with other pin-outs). With normal GBA hardware it is just
producing an interesting dirt effect.
The NDS DISPCNT registers are 32bit (4000000h..4000003h), so Green Swap
doesn\'t exist in NDS mode, however, the NDS does support Green Swap i
GBA mode.
