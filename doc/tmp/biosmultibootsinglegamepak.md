# BIOS Multi Boot (Single Game Pak)


MultiBoot

**SWI 25h (GBA) - MultiBoot**
This function uploads & starts program code to slave GBAs, allowing to
launch programs on slave units even if no cartridge is inserted into the
slaves (this works because all GBA BIOSes contain built-in download
procedures in ROM).
However, the SWI 25h BIOS upload function covers only 45% of the
required Transmission Protocol, the other 55% must be coded in the
master cartridge (see Transmission Protocol below).

```

See below for more details.

**Multiboot Parameter Structure**
Size of parameter structure should be 4Ch bytes (the current GBA BIOS
uses only first 44h bytes though). The following entries must be set
before calling SWI 25h:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Addr Size Name/Expl.                                            |
|       14h  1    handshake_data (entry used for normal mode only)      |
- |       19h  3    client_data[1,2,3]                                    |
|       1Ch  1    palette_data                                          |
|       1Eh  1    client_bit (Bit 1-3 set if child 1-3 detected)        |
|       20h  4    boot_srcp  (typically 8000000h+0C0h)                  |
|       24h  4    boot_endp  (typically 8000000h+0C0h+length)           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The transfer length (excluding header data) should be a multiple of 10h,
minimum length 100h, max 3FF40h (ca. 256KBytes). Set palette_data as
\"81h+color\*10h+direction\*8+speed\*2\", or as \"0f1h+color\*2\" fo
fixed palette, whereas color=0..6, speed=0..3, direction=0..1. The other
- entries (handshake_data, client_data\[1-3\], and client_bit) must b
same as specified in Transmission Protocol (see below hh,cc,y).

**Multiboot Transfer Protocol**
Below describes the complete transfer protocol, normally only the
Initiation part must be programmed in the master cartridge, the main
data transfer can be then performed by calling SWI 25h, the slave
program is started after SWI 25h completion.
The ending handshake is normally not required, when using it, note that
you will need custom code in BOTH master and slave programs.

**Multiboot Communication**
In Multiplay mode, master sends 16bit data, and receives 16bit data from
each slave (or FFFFh if none). In Normal mode, master sends 32bit data
(upper 16bit zero, lower 16bit as for multiplay mode), and receives
32bit data (upper 16bit as for multiplay mode, and lower 16bit same as
lower 16bit previously sent by master). Because SIODATA32 occupies same
addresses as SIOMULTI0-1, the same transfer code can be used for both
multiplay and normal mode (in normal mode SIOMULTI2-3 should be forced
to FFFFh though). After each transfer, master should wait for Start bit
cleared in SIOCNT register, followed by a 36us delay.
Note: The multiboot slave would also recognize data being sent in Joybus
mode, however, master GBAs cannot use joybus mode (because GBA hardware
cannot act as master in joybus mode).

**Multiboot Slave Header**
The transferred Header block is written to 2000000-20000BFh in slave
RAM, the header must contain valid data (identically as for normal
ROM-cartridge headers, including a copy of the Nintendo logo, correct
header CRC, etc.), in most cases it\'d be recommended just to transfer 
copy of the master cartridges header from 8000000h-80000BFh.

**Multiboot Slave Program/Data**
The transferred main program/data block is written to 20000C0h and up
(max 203FFFFh) in slave RAM, note that absolute addresses in the program
must be then originated at 2000000h rather than 8000000h. In case that
the master cartridge is 256K or less, it could just transfer a copy of
the whole cartridge at 80000C0h and up, the master should then copy &
execute its own ROM data into RAM as well.

**Multiboot Slave Extended Header**
For Multiboot slaves, separate Entry Point(s) must be defined at the
beginning of the Program/Data block (the Entry Point in the normal
header is ignored), also some reserved bytes in this section are
overwritten by the Multiboot procedure. For more information see chapter
about Cartridge Header.

**Multiboot Slave with Cartridge**
Beside for slaves without cartridge, multiboot can be also used for
slaves which do have a cartridge inserted, if so, SELECT and START must
be kept held down during power-on in order to switch the slave GBA into
Multiboot mode (ie. to prevent it from starting the cartridge as
normally).
The general idea is to enable newer programs to link to any existing
older GBA programs, even if these older programs originally didn\'t hav
been intended to support linking.
The uploaded program may access the slaves SRAM, Flash ROM, or EEPROM
(if any, allowing to read out or modify slave game positions), as well
as cartridge ROM at 80000A0h-8000FFFh (the first 4KBytes, excluding the
nintendo logo, allowing to read out the cartridge name from the header,
for example).
The main part of the cartridge ROM is meant to be locked out in order to
prevent software pirates from uploading \"intruder\" programs whic
would send back a copy of the whole cartridge to the master, however,
for good or evil, at present time, current GBA models and GBA carts do
not seem to contain any such protection.

**Uploading Programs from PC**
Beside for the ability to upload a program from one GBA to another, this
feature can be also used to upload small programs from a PC to a GBA.
For more information see chapter about External Connectors.

**Nintendo DS**
The GBA multiboot function requires a link port, and so, works on GBA
and GBA SP only. The Nintendo DS in GBA mode does include the multiboot
BIOS function, but it won\'t be of any use as the DS doesn\'t have 
link port.
