### Random notes
After writing to a keyslot, the keyslot must be selected again (write AES_KEYSEL + set AES_CNT bit26), even when writing to the same keyslot. Writing the last word to a key FIFO immediately after selecting a keyslot will not affect the keyslot keydata that gets used at that time, the new keydata will not get used until the keyslot gets selected again.

Writing to the key FIFOs with byte writes results in the AES engine converting the byte to a word (word=byte\*01010101h). The result is the same regardless of which FIFO register byte was written to.

The key FIFOs can be written simultaneously. For example, executing the following will result in the keyX and keyY being set to all-zero (unknown for normalkey): memset(0x10009100, 0, 0x100); uh, does that mean there are mirrors at 1000910Ch and up?

Each key FIFO has a 10h-byte tmp-buffer for storing the words written to that FIFO. Once the last word is written to a key FIFO, the filled tmp-buffer is then written to the key-data for the keyslot selected by AES_KEYCNT at the time the last word was written.

### FIRM-launch key clearing
Starting with 9.0.0-20 the Process9 FIRM-launch code now \"clears\" the following AES keyslots, with certain keydata by writing the normal-key: 0x15 and 0x18-0x20. These are the keyslots used by the New3DS FIRM arm9bin loader (minus keyslot 0x11), the New3DS Process9 does this too.
