# DS Sound Files - HWAS (Multiblock Sound Wave Data)


Used in NDS Over the Hedge, rom:\\vvobj\\generated\\gob\\main.gfc an
main.gob
Used in NDS Downhill Jam, rom:\\vvobj\\generated\\gob\\main.gfc an
main.gob
(the Hedge/Downhill archives contain both .hwas and .swav files, plus
other stuff).
Reportedly, Guitar Heroes On Tour series does also use .hwas files.

The .hwas format contains more or less the same data as Nintendo\'
.swav format:
- [DS Sound Files - SWAV (Sound WaveData)](./dssoundfilesswavsoundwavedata.md)
The main difference is that .swav has only one data block, and .hwas is
split into several data blocks (each with their own 4-byte adpcm
header).
