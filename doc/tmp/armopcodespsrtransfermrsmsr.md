|     In source code, a 32bit immediate should be specified as operand. |

|     The assembler should then convert that into a shifted 8bit value. |

```

MSR/MRS and CPSR/SPSR supported by ARMv3 and up.
ARMv2 and below contained PSR flags in R15, accessed by
CMP/CMN/TST/TEQ{P}.
The field mask bits specify which bits of the destination Psr are
write-able (or write-protected), one or more of these bits should be
set, for example, CPSR_fsxc (aka CPSR aka CPSR_all) unlocks all bits
(see below user mode restriction though).
Restrictions:
In non-privileged mode (user mode): only condition code bits of CPSR can
be changed, control bits can\'t.
Only the SPSR of the current mode can be accessed; In User and System
modes no SPSR exists.
The T-bit may not be changed; for THUMB/ARM switching use BX
instruction.
Unused Bits in CPSR are reserved for future use and should never be
changed (except for unused bits in the flags field).
Execution Time: 1S.

Note: The A22i assembler recognizes MOV as alias for both MSR and MRS
because it is practically not possible to remember whether MSR or MRS
was the load or store opcode, and/or whether it does load to or from the
Psr register.
