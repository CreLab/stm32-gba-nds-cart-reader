**Normal Connection**
Just connect the plugs to the two GBAs and leave the Middle Socket
disconnected, in this mode both GBAs may behave as master or slave,
regardless of whether using big or small plugs.
The GBA is (NOT ???) able to communicate in Normal mode with MultiPlay
cables which do not have crossed SI/SO lines.

**Multi-Play Connection**
Connect two GBAs as normal, for each further GBAs connect an additional
cable to the Middle socket of the first (or further) cable(s), up to
four GBAs may be connected by using up to three cables.
The GBA which is connected to a Small Plug is master, the slaves are all
connected to Large Plugs. (Only small plugs fit into the Middle Socket,
so it\'s not possible to mess up something here).

**Multi-Boot Connection**
MultiBoot (SingleGamepak) is typically using Multi-Play communication,
in this case it is important that the Small plug is connected to the
master/sender (ie. to the GBA that contains the cartridge).

**Non-GBA Mode Connection**
First of all, it is not possible to link between 32bit GBA games and
8bit games, parts because of different cable protocol, and parts because
of different signal voltages.
However, when a 8bit cartridge is inserted (the GBA is switched into
8bit compatibility mode) it may be connected to other 8bit games
(monochrome gameboys, CGBs, or to other GBAs which are in 8bit mode
also, but not to GBAs in 32bit mode).
When using 8bit link mode, an 8bit link cable must be used. The GBA link
cables won\'t work, see below modification though.

**Using a GBA 32bit cable for 8bit communication**
Open the middle socket, and disconnect Small Plugs SI from GND, and
connect SI to Large Plugs SO instead. You may also want to install a
switch that allows to switch between SO and GND, the GND signal should
be required for MultiPlay communication only though.
Also, cut off the plastic ledge from the plugs so that they fit into
8bit gameboy sockets.

**Using a GBA 8bit cable for 32bit communication**
The cable should theoretically work as is, as the grounded SI would be
required for MultiPlay communication only. However, software that uses
SD for Slave-Ready detection won\'t work unless when adding a SD-to-S
connection (the 8bit plugs probably do not even contain SD pins
though).
