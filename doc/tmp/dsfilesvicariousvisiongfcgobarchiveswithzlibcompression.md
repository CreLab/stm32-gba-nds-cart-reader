Larger files can consist of several compressed and/or uncompressed
clusters, that allows random-access to compressed files (without needing
to decompress the preceeding clusters; provided that the decompressor
knows maximum size of the the uncompressed cluster; that is 2000h on
NDS?).
Small files (and last cluster of larger files) may be left uncompressed
(if they are considered to be small enough without compression).

**Cluster Checksums**
The Cluster Checksums (in .GFC) contain ADLER32 checksums on the
compressed data. The zlib compressed data (.in GOB) additionally
includes a ADLER32 on the uncompressed data.
Caution: ADLER32 is usally computed with InitialValue=00000001h (aka
2x16bit 0001h,0000h). However, the .GFC and .GOB are using
InitialValue=00000000h, this is incompatible with unmodified zlib
functions.

**Basic File Table (sorted by filename CRC32s)**
Files are accessed via filename CRCs (that can be faster than string
compare, but fails if two filenames have the same CRCs; the dev tool has
error checking for that, and the developer must then rename one of the
files).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 4    CRC32 on lowercase filename, excluding ending zero    |
|       004h 4    Filesize (of uncompressed file)                       |
|                                                                       |
|    008h 4    First Cluster Number in Cluster Table (0..NumClusters-1) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Examples names found in the NDS Over the Hedge executable:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ".\strm                                                         
| \LA_BG.hwas"   --> CRC32=522AFF5Dh (with name converted to lowercase) 
|       ".\strm\                                                        
| boy_tv2.hwas" --> CRC32=F047AA4Eh (with name already being lowercase) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Extended File Table (if any, not included in NDS retail titles)**
This contains a list of all filenames, but does apparently exist in dev
version only. The retail version does have filenames in the executable
(but they may be scattered around at various locations, or even
generated on the fly, eg. path+filename+index+ext).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|     000h 60h  Filename in lowercase ASCII (eg. ".\path\name.ext",00h) 
|       060h 4    CRC32 on uncompressed file data                       |
|       064h 4    Timestamp                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Compressed .GOB file**
Compression=NONE stores uncompressed clusters, except: if the remaining
file size (in last cluster of the file) is smaller than ClusterSize then
it stores only that many bytes in the .GOB file.
Compression=ZLIB stores 2-byte ZLIB header, deflated data, and 4-byte
checksum, except: the initial checksum value is different as in standard
zlib functions (see above notes on ADLER32).

**Variants**
The GFC/GOP format is used in different games on different consoles.
Some hardcoded parameters may differ (and, unfortunately, the file
header doesn\'t contain that info):
