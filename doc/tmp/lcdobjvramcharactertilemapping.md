# LCD OBJ - VRAM Character (Tile) Mapping


Each OBJ tile consists of 8x8 dots, however, bigger OBJs can be
displayed by combining several 8x8 tiles. The horizontal and vertical
size for each OBJ may be separately defined in OAM, possible H/V sizes
are 8,16,32,64 dots - allowing \'square\' OBJs to be used (such lik
8x8, 16x16, etc) as well as \'rectangular\' OBJs (such like 8x32, 64x16
etc.)

When displaying an OBJ that contains of more than one 8x8 tile, one of
the following two mapping modes can be used. In either case, the tile
number of the upperleft tile must be specified in OAM memory.

**Two Dimensional Character Mapping (DISPCNT Bit 6 cleared)**
This mapping mode assumes that the 1024 OBJ tiles are arranged as a
matrix of 32x32 tiles / 256x256 pixels (In 256 color mode: 16x32 tiles /
128x256 pixels). Ie. the upper row of this matrix contains tiles
00h-1Fh, the next row tiles 20h-3Fh, and so on.
For example, when displaying a 16x16 pixel OBJ, with tile number set to
04h; The upper row of the OBJ will consist of tile 04h and 05h, the next
row of 24h and 25h. (In 256 color mode: 04h and 06h, 24h and 26h.)

**One Dimensional Character Mapping (DISPCNT Bit 6 set)**
In this mode, tiles are mapped each after each other from 00h-3FFh.
Using the same example as above, the upper row of the OBJ will consist
of tile 04h and 05h, the next row of tile 06h and 07h. (In 256 color
mode: 04h and 06h, 08h and 0Ah.)
