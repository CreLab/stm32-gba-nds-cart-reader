# DSi Console IDs


The DSi contains several unique per-console numbers:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       C                                                               |
| PU/Console ID     - Found in Port 4004D00h, in AES Keys, and in Files |
|                                                                       |
|      eMMC CID Register  - Found in Main RAM, and in eMMC CID register |
|       Serial/                                                         |
| Barcode     - Found in Main RAM, and on stickers, and in HWINFO_S.dat |
|       Wifi MAC Address   - Found in Main RAM, and in Wifi FLASH       |
|       Nintendo WFC ID    - Found in Wifi FLASH                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**4004D00h - DSi7 - CPU/Console ID Code (64bit) (R)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-63  CPU/Console ID Code                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This appears to be a PROM inside of the CPU TWL chip. The value is used
to initialize KEY_X values for eMMC encryption/decryption. Common 64bit
settings are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       08201nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi (EUR) and DSi XL (USA)               |
|       08202nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi XL                                   |
|       08203nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi XL                                   |
|       08204nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi                                      |
|       08A15???????????h  for DSi                                      |
|       08A18nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi (USA) (black)                        |
|       08A19nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi (USA)                                |
|       08A20nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi                                      |
|       08A21nnnnnnnn1nnh  for DSi                                      |
|       08A22???????????h  for DSi (USA)                                |
|       08A23???????????h  for DSi (EUR)                                |
|       08C267B7xxxxxxxxh  for 3DS                                      |
|       6B27D20002000000h  for n3DS (unknown how that has happened)     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The \"n\" digits appear to be always in BCD range (0..9), the othe
digits appear to be fixed (on known consoles).
The 64bit value is also stored as 16-byte ASCII string in \"dev.kp\"
And, the ASCII string is also stored in footer of \"Tad Files on S
Cards\".
Port 4004D00h should be read only if the flag in 4004D08h is zero.
Moreover, Port 4004D00h can be read only by firmware, and get\'
disabled for all known games, so most exploits will only see zeroes in
4004D00h..4004D08h.
Easiest way to obtain the 64bit value would be extracting it from SD
Card (using modified \"DSi SRL Extract\" source code).
- [DSi SD/MMC DSiware Files on External SD Card (.bin aka TadFiles)](./dsisdmmcdsiwarefilesonexternalsdcardbinakatadfiles.md)
Obtaining the 64bit value by DSi software is working only indirectly:
With sudokuhax it can be simply \"read\" from 40044E0h (LSW) an
40044ECh (MSW). Whereas, that ports are write-only, so it needs some
small efforts to \"read\" them.
With DSi cartridge exploits it\'s a bit more difficult: The values a
40044D4h..40044FBh are destroyed, but 40044D0h..40044D3h is left intact,
which can be used to compute the original MSW value at 40044ECh, using a
bunch of constants and maths operations (caution: the result may depend
on carry-in from unknown LSBs, eg. the MSW may appear as 08A2nnnnh or
08E2nnnnh). Next, one can simply brute-force the LSW (there should be
only 10 million combinations (assuming it to be a BCD number with one
fixed digit), which could be scanned within less than 6 minutes using
the DSi AES hardware).
Note: JimmyZ made some PC tools (\"TWLbf\" and \"bfCL\") that ca
bruteforce the Console ID or CID (or both) from encrypted eMMC images.

**4004D08h - DSi7 - CPU/Console ID Flag (1bit) (R)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     CPU/Console ID Flag (0=Okay/Ready, 1=Bad/Busy)            |
|       1-15  Unknown/Unused (0)                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Some flag that indicates whether one can read the CPU/Console ID from
Port 4004D00h. The flag should be usually zero (unknown when it could be
nonzero, maybe shortly after power-up, or maybe when the internal PROM
wasn\'t programmed yet; which should never happen in retail units).

**eMMC CID Register**
The CID can be read via SD/MMC commands, and it\'s also stored a
2FFD7BCh in RAM; the RAM value is little-endian 120bit (ie. without the
CRC7 byte), zeropadded to 16-bytes (with 00h in MSB); the value looks as
so;

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       MY ss ss                                                        |

|       MY ss ss                                                        |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The value is used to initialize AES_IV register for eMMC
encryption/decryption.
The \"MY\" byte contains month/year; with Y=0Bh..0Dh for 2008..201
(Y=0Eh..0Fh would be 2011..2012, but there aren\'t any known DSi/3D
consoles using that values) (unknown how 2013 and up would be assigned;
JEDEC didn\'t seem to mind to define them yet). The \"ss\" digits are 
32bit serial number (or actually it looks more like a 32bit random
number, not like an incrementing serial value).
Without a working exploit (for reading RAM at 2FFD7BCh), the CID could
be obtained by connecting wires to the eMMC chip. However, this might
require whatever custom hardware/software setup (unknown if any standard
tools like PC card readers are able to read the CID value).
Note: JimmyZ made some PC tools (\"TWLbf\" and \"bfCL\") that ca
bruteforce the Console ID or CID (or both) using hex values extracted
from encrypted eMMC images.
To speedup CID bruting, one can extract the MY datecode from \"Samsun
YWW, KMAPF0000M-S998\" text printed on the eMMC chip: the \"YWW\" i
year/week, eg. 8xx means 2008, and translates to year \"B\" in th
\"MY\" field.
For the ST chips, there seems to me a similar year/week (reading \"KO
99 YWW\", but the year/week on ST chips is usually about a month olde
than the month/year in CID). Known ST date codes are AC/BC
(Oct2009/Nov2009) for the \"rev0\" ones, and CC/1D (Dec2009/Jan2010) fo
the \"rev1\" ones (ie. the ST chips seem to have been mostly used i
early DSi XL models).

**Serial/Barcode**
The barcode is found on a sticker on the bottom of console (and on an
identical sticker underneath of the battery). It\'s also stored as ASCI
string in HWINFO_S.dat file, and at 2FFFD71h in RAM.
The serial/barcode consists of 2-3 letters, followed by 8 digits,
followed by a checksum digit.
The first letter indicates the console model:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       DSi             T  (or V for devunits)                          |
|       DSi XL/LL       W  (or unknown for devunits)                    |
|       3DS             C  (or E for devunits)                          |
|       3DS XL/LL       S  (or R for devunits)                          |
|       2DS             A  (or P for devunits)                          |
|       New 3DS         Y  (or Yxx00 for devunits)                      |
|       New 3DS XL/LL   Q  (or Qxx00 for devunits)                      |
|       New 2DS XL/LL   N  (or Nxx01 for devunits)                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The next 1-2 letter(s) indicate the region:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       JPN Japan                             JF,JH,JM                  |
|       USA North America                     W                         |
|       USA Middle East, Southeast Asia       S                         |
|       EUR Europe                            EF,EH,EM                  |
|       AUS Australia (for 3DS: part of EUR)  AG,AH                     |
|       CHN China (iQue)                      CF,CH,CM                  |
|       KOR South Korea                       KF,KH,KM                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The checksum can be calculated across 1st-8th digit (and ignoring the
leading letters):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       9th = (250 - (1st+3rd+5th+7th) - 3*(2nd+4th+6th+8th)) mod 10    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unknown if the barcode is internally used for any purposes (such like
encryption, or network identification).

**dev.kp**
This file contains another \"TWxxxxxxxx\" ID (with \"xxxxxxxx\" being 
32bit lowercase hex number), this 32bit Console ID is also used in .tik
files (except in tickets for free system titles).

**Wifi MAC Address - Found in Main RAM, Wifi FLASH, and Wifi EEPROM**
The MAC is a unique 48bit number needed for Wifi communications. The MAC
is stored in SPI bus Wifi FLASH, and it\'s also stored at 2FFFCF4h i
RAM. The same MAC value is also stored in I2C bus Wifi EEPROM. The MAC
can be also viewed in Firmware (see System Settings, Internet, Options,
System Information). Common values for DSi are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00 22 4C xx xx xx    ;seen in DSi XL                            |
|       00 23 CC xx xx xx    ;seen in DSi                               |
|       00 24 1E xx xx xx    ;seen in DSi                               |
|       00 27 09 xx xx xx    ;seen in DSi                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The value isn\'t used for eMMC encryption (the eMMC is still accessibl
when swapping the Wifi daughterboard). However, the MAC value is
included in game \".bin\" files stored on SD card (unknown if that i
causing any issues when loading those games on a console with swapped
Wifi daughterboard).

**Nintendo WFC ID**
This is some unknown purpose value stored in Wifi FLASH. The value can
be viewed in Firmware (see System Settings, Internet, Options, System
Information). The firmware does only show the lower 43bit of the value,
in decimal format, multiplied by 1000, whilst the actual WFC in FLASH
seems to be about 14 bytes (112bit). The firmware does also allow to
\"delete\" and \"transfer\" the \"WFC Configuration\" (whatever tha
means).

**Flipnote Studio ID**
This ID consists of a 16-digit HEX number (can be viewed by clicking the
\"tool\" symbol in upper right of Flipnote\'s main menu).
The first 8-digits have unknown meaning. The last 8-digits are same as
the last 8-digits of the wifi MAC address.
