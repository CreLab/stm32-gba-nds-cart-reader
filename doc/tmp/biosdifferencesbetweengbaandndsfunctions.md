# BIOS Differences between GBA and NDS functions


### Differences between GBA and NDS BIOS functions
- SoftReset uses different addresses
- SWI numbers for Halt, Stop/Sleep, Div, Sqrt have changed
- Halt destroys r0 on NDS9, IntrWait bugged on NDS9
- CpuFastSet allows 4-byte blocks (nice), but\...
- CpuFastSet works very SLOW because of a programming bug (uncool)
- Some of the decompression functions are now using callbacks
- SoundBias uses new delay parameter
And, a number of GBA functions have been removed, and some new NDS functions have been added, see:
