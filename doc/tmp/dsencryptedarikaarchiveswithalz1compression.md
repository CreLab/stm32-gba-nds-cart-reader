# DS Encrypted Arika Archives with ALZ1 compression


Used in Arika\'s DSi Dr. Mario and reportedly also in other Arik
titles.

Arika Directory Entry format:

```

|       000h 20h   Filename (ASCII, max 31 chars, plus zeropadding)     |
|       020h 4     File Size in bytes                                   |
|       024h 4     File Offset in sector units (in GAME.DAT file)       |
|       028h 4     File Size in sector units                            |
|       02Ch 4                                                          |
- |     Decompressed File Size in bytes (same as [20h] when uncompressed) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The file names must contain lowercase \"a..z\" in first character (th
software is generating a not-so-fast \"quick lookup table\" based on th
1st char, and produces memory corruption if it\'s outside of th
\"a..z\" range).
Arika archives contain only files, not folders. However, the filenames
do usually contain slashes (eg. \"com/chr/e_eff_vy01.dat\"), so softwar
could split those names into folder+filename, if desired.

**Arika INFO.DAT decryption**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       if buf[0]=00h then exit ;unencrypted                            |
|       fo                                                              |
- | r i=10h to filesize-1, buf[i]=((buf[i] ror 4) xor FFh)-buf[i AND 0Fh] |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The strength of the 10h-byte key pattern is that people will have a hard
time to realize that the file is encrypted at all; otherwise they could
easily decrypt it by just gazing at it in a hex editor.

**Arika ALZ1 compression**
ALZ1 is almost identical to LZss, with some useless changes:
The 4-byte fileheader contains \"ALZ1\", without any info about th
decompressed size (which must be taken from INFO.DAT instead).
The compression flags are inverted (0=compressed), and processed
backwards (LSB first).
The dictionary is stored in separate 1000h-byte ringbuffer (which is
initially zerofilled, so the files can directly start with compressed
00h bytes).
The 16bit compression codes are byte-swapped (1st byte is dict.lsb, 2nd
byte is dict.msb\*10h+(len-3)), with dict being the dictionary\'s rea
index.
The dictionary\'s initial write index is FEEh, al
compressed/uncompressed data written to dest is also written to the
dictionary.

ALZ1 compression is also used in PSX Power Spike (in BIZ archives inside
of the main IDX/HUG archive). There are two small differences: The DSi
version does have the compressed data prefixed by ID \"ALZ1\" (the PS
version doesn\'t have that prefix). The DSi version requires th
ringbuffer to be initially zerofilled (the PSX version uses an
uncompressed 00h byte before using compressed zeroes).

**Arika ALZ1+LZrev double compression**
The file \"com/m2dres_narc.blz\" is double compressed (LZrev inside o
ALZ1, which can actually reduce the size because LZrev or ALZ1 alone are
having rather poor compression ratios) (whereas, LZrev can be only
detected via the \".blz\" extension, so make sure not to forget th
extension after handling the first compression layer).
Other files like \"lng/eur/fr/man/man_narc.blz\" are only LZre
compressed.

**Note**
ALZ1 seems to be identical to LArc\'s lz5 compression method (excep
that ALZ1 does initially zerofill the ringbuf; whilst lz5 is using
different initial byte patterns).
