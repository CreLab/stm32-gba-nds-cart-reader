```

Most of these registers are same as on DSi:
- [DSi AES I/O Ports](./dsiaesioports.md)
New features are more keyslots, CBC/ECB modes, optional big-endian mode,
and a new Key X/Y scrambler.

\"The hardware key generator is triggered by writing the keyY, which i
the only way to trigger it with the 3DS keyslots. The algorithm for
generating the normal-key from keyX and keyY is as follows\":

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       KeyDSi =                                                        |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Key 0-3 are writeable only via the old DSi-style AES_KEY0..3 registers
(not via AES_KEYxyFIFO), and key0-3 are always using the old DSi-style
Key scrambler. Key 0-3 can be used in 3DS and DSi mode, but they are
reset to zero on 3DS-to-DSi mode switch, and thus need to be
(re-)initialized in DSi mode.

**10009100h - ARM9 - AES_KEYFIFO - Normal Key (four words)**
**10009104h - ARM9 - AES_KEYXFIFO - Key X (four words)**
**10009108h - ARM9 - AES_KEYYFIFO - Key Y (four words)**
Whatever, new (unlike DSi).
The Key FIFO\'s are automatically flushed after each 4 words, and afte
setting AES_KEYCNT.bit7, and reportedly also when changing the AES_CNT
word order.

**Notes**
When AES_CNT.bit31 is set, then AES_CNT essentially becomes locked and
doesn\'t change when written to. However if AES_CNT.bit26 is \"set\"
keyslot-selection is cued to be handled when AES_CNT.bit31 is cleared.
Clearing AES_CNT.bit31 while the AES engine is doing crypto will result
in the AES engine stopping crypto, once it finishes processing the
current block.

**10009004h - ARM9 - AES_MACEXTRABLKCNT**
(CCM-MAC extra data length)\>\>4, ie. the number of block of CCM-MA
extra data.

**10009006h - ARM9 - AES_BLKCNT**
(Data length)\>\>4, ie. the number of blocks to process

**10009008h - ARM9 - AES_WRFIFO**
**1000900Ch - ARM9 - AES_RDFIFO**
Reading from AES_RDFIFO when there\'s no data available in the RDFIF
will result in reading the last word that was in the RDFIFO.
When triggering either RDFIFO or WRFIFO to be flushed, the AES Engine
does not clear either buffer.
Word order and endianness can be changed between each read/write to
these FIFOs. However changing the word order when writing to WRFIFO can
cause the word to be written outside the current block, leaving
uninitialized data in its place. Attempts to change endianness or word
order are not honored when reading from RDFIFO when no more data is
available.

**10009020h - ARM9 - AES_IV (16 bytes)**
This register specifies the counter (CTR mode), nonce (CCM mode) or the
initialization vector (CBC mode) depending on the mode of operation. For
CBC and CTR mode this register takes up the full 16 bytes, but for CCM
mode the nonce is only the first 12 bytes. The AES engine will
automatically increment the counter up to the maximum BLKCNT, after
which point it must be manually incremented and set again.

**10009030h - ARM9 - AES_MAC (16 bytes)**
This register specifies the message authentication code (MAC) for use in
CCM mode.

**10009040h/10009070h/100090A0h/100090D0h - AES_KEY0/1/2/3**
These registers are the same as they were on TWL, and are likely
preserved for compatibility reasons. The keyslot is updated immediately
after \*any\* data(u8/u32/\...) is written here, which was used on DS
to break the key-generator.

**CCM mode pitfall**
Non-standard AES-CCM behaviour is observed on Wrap/Unwrap function.
According to RFC 3610, the first block B_0 for authentication should be
generated from the message length and some other parameters. Using these
function, it seems that the message length is aligned up to 16 when
generating B_0. This makes the generated MAC not compliant with the
standard when (inputsize-noncesize)%16!=0. It is very likely that this
non-standard behaviour happens on the hardware level, but not confirmed
yet.

|       uh, or does it just OMIT that, as on DSi?                       |
|       instead of that "aligned" thing?                                |
