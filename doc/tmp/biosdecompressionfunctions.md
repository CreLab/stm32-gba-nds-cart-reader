**Decompression Read/Write Variants**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ReadNormal:      Fast (src must be memory mapped)               |
|       ReadB                                                           |
| yCallback:  Slow (src can be non-memory, eg. serial Firmware SPI bus) |
|                                                                       |
|   Write8bitUnits:  Fast (dest must support 8bit writes, eg. not VRAM) |
|                                                                       |
|      Write16bitUnits: Slow (dest must be halfword-aligned) (for VRAM) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**BitUnPack - SWI 10h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9)**
Used to increase the color depth of bitmaps or tile data. For example,
to convert a 1bit monochrome font into 4bit or 8bit GBA tiles. The
Unpack Info is specified separately, allowing to convert the same source
data into different formats.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0  Source Address      (no alignment required)                 |
|       r1  Destination Address (must be 32bit-word aligned)            |
|       r2  Pointer to UnPack information:                              |
|            16bit  Length of Source Data in bytes     (0-FFFFh)        |
|                                                                       |
|    8bit   Width of Source Units in bits      (only 1,2,4,8 supported) |
|            8bi                                                        |
| t   Width of Destination Units in bits (only 1,2,4,8,16,32 supported) |
|            32bit  Data Offset (Bit 0-30), and Zero Data Flag (Bit 31) |
|                                                                       |
|         The Data Offset is always added to all non-zero source units. |
|                                                                       |
|        If the Zero Data Flag was set, it is also added to zero units. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Data is written in 32bit units, Destination can be Wram or Vram. The
size of unpacked data must be a multiple of 4 bytes. The width of source
units (plus the offset) should not exceed the destination width.
Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.

**Diff8bitUnFilterWrite8bit (Wram) - SWI 16h (GBA/NDS9/DSi9)**
**Diff8bitUnFilterWrite16bit (Vram) - SWI 17h (GBA)**
**Diff16bitUnFilter - SWI 18h (GBA/NDS9/DSi9)**
These aren\'t actually real decompression functions, destination dat
will have exactly the same size as source data. However, assume a bitmap
or wave form to contain a stream of increasing numbers such like 10..19,
the filtered/unfiltered data would be:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       unfiltered:   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19            |
|       filtered:     10  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1  +1            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In this case using filtered data (combined with actual compression
algorithms) will obviously produce better compression results.
Data units may be either 8bit or 16bit used with Diff8bit or Diff16bit
functions respectively.

```

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.

**HuffUnCompReadNormal - SWI 13h (GBA)**
**HuffUnCompReadByCallback - SWI 13h (NDS/DSi)**
The decoder starts in root node, the separate bits in the bitstream
specify if the next node is node0 or node1, if that node is a data node,
then the data is stored in memory, and the decoder is reset to the root
node. The most often used data should be as close to the root node as
possible. For example, the 4-byte string \"Huff\" could be compressed t
6 bits: 10-11-0-0, with root.0 pointing directly to data \"f\", an
root.1 pointing to a child node, whose nodes point to data \"H\" an
data \"u\".
Data is written in units of 32bits, if the size of the compressed data
is not a multiple of 4, please adjust it as much as possible by padding
with 0.
Align the source address to a 4Byte boundary.

Expands LZ77-compressed data. The Wram function is faster, and writes in
units of 8bits. For the Vram function the destination must be halfword
aligned, data is written in units of 16bits.
- [LZ Decompression Functions](./lzdecompressionfunctions.md)
- CAUTION: Writing 16bit units to \[dest-1\] instead of 8bit units t
- \[dest\] means that reading from \[dest-1\] won\'t work, ie. th
\"Vram\" function works only with disp=001h..FFFh, but not wit
disp=000h.
If the size of the compressed data is not a multiple of 4, please adjust
it as much as possible by padding with 0. Align the source address to a
4-Byte boundary.

**NDS/DSi Decompression Callbacks**
On NDS and DSi, the \"ReadByCallback\" variants are reading source dat
from callback functions (rather than directly from memory). The callback
functions may read normal data from memory, or from other devices, such
like directly from the gamepak bus, without storing the source data in
memory. The downside is that the callback mechanism makes the function
very slow, furthermore, NDS7/NDS9 SWI 12h, 13h, 15h are using THUMB
code, and variables on stack, alltogether that makes the whole shit
very-very-very slow.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|     r2 = user defined callback parameter (passed on to Open function) |

|      (or, for Huffman: pointer to temp buffer, max 200h bytes needed) |
|       r3 = pointer to callback structure                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Callback structure (five 32bit pointers to callback functions)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       Open_and_get_32bit (eg. LDR r0,[r0], get header)                |
|       Close              (optional, 0=none)                           |
- |       Get_8bit           (eg. LDRB r0,[r0])                           |
|       Get_16bit          (not used)                                   |
|       Get_32bit          (used by Huffman only)                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All functions may use ARM or THUMB code (indicated by address bit0). The
current source address (r0) is passed to all callback functions.
Additionally, the initial destination address (r1), and a user defined
parameter (r2) are passed to the Open function. For Huffman r2 must
point to a temp buffer (max 200h bytes needed, internally used by the
SWI function to make a copy of the huffman tree; needed for
random-access to the tree, which wouldn\'t work with the sequentiall
reading callbacks).
All functions have return values in r0. The Open function normally
returns the first word (containing positive length and type),
alternatively it may return a negative error code to abort/reject
decompression. The Close function, if it is defined, should return zero
(or any positive value), or a negative errorcode. The other functions
return raw data, without errorcodes. The SWI returns the length of
decompressed data, or the signed errorcode from the Open/Close
functions.
