# DS 3D Status


### 4000600h - GXSTAT - Geometry Engine Status Register (R and R/W)
Bit 30-31 are R/W. Writing \"1\" to Bit15 does reset the Error Flag (Bit15), and additionally resets the Projection Stack Pointer (Bit13), and probably (?) also the Texture Stack Pointer. All other GXSTAT bits are read-only.

```

|       13    Projection Matrix Stack Level        (0..1)                             |
|       14    Matrix Stack Busy (0=No, 1=Yes; Currently executing a Push/Pop command) |
|       15    Matrix Stack Overflow/Underflow Error (0=No, 1=Error/Acknowledge/Reset) |
|       16-24 Number of 40bit-entries in Command FIFO  (0..256)                       |
|      (24)   Command FIFO Full (MSB of above)  (0=No, 1=Yes; Full)                   |
|       25    Command FIFO Less Than Half Full  (0=No, 1=Yes; Less than Half-full)    |
|       26    Command FIFO Empty                (0=No, 1=Yes; Empty)                  |
|       27    Geometry Engine Busy (0=No, 1=Yes; Busy; Commands are executing)        |
|       28-29 Not used                                                                |
|       30-31 Command FIFO IRQ (0=Never, 1=Less than half full, 2=Empty, 3=Reserved)  |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When GXFIFO IRQ is enabled (setting 1 or 2), the IRQ flag (IF.Bit21) is set while and as long as the IRQ condition is true (and attempts to acknowledge the IRQ by writing to IF.Bit21 have no effect). So that, the IRQ handler must either fill the FIFO, or disable the IRQ (setting 0), BEFORE trying to acknowledge the IRQ.

### 4000604h - RAM_COUNT - Polygon List & Vertex RAM Count Register (R)

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-11   Number of Polygons currently stored in Polygon List RAM (0..2048) |
|       12-15  Not used                                                          |
|       16-28  Number of Vertices currently stored in Vertex RAM       (0..6144) |
|       13-15  Not used                                                          |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If a SwapBuffers command has been sent, then the counters are reset 10 cycles (at 33.51MHz clock) after next VBlank.

### 4000320h - RDLINES_COUNT - Rendered Line Count Register (R)
Rendering starts in scanline 214, the rendered lines are stored in a buffer that can hold up to 48 scanlines. The actual screen output begins after scanline 262, the lines are then read from the buffer and sent to the display. Simultaneously, the rendering engine keeps writing new lines to the buffer (ideally at the same speed than display output, so the buffer would always contain 48 pre-calculated lines).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-5    Minimum Number (minus 2) of buffered lines in previous frame (0..46) |
|       6-31   Not used                                                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If rendering becomes slower than the display output, then the number of buffered lines decreases. Smaller values in RDLINES indicate that additional load to the rendering engine may cause buffer underflows in further frames, if so, the program should reduce the number of polygons to avoid display glitches.
Even if RDLINES becomes zero, it doesn\'t indicate whether actual buffer underflows have occured or not (underflows are indicated in DISP3DCNT Bit12).
