# Pocketstation Emulation


The Sony Pocketstation is a memory card with ARM processor and 32x32
pixel LCD screen for Sony Playstation consoles. As such, it doesn\'
have much to do with GBA/NDS.
Anyways, as I haven\'t got around to implement ARM emulation in no\$ps
yet, the Pocketstation is currently emulated as part of the no\$gb
project (eventually it might be moving from no\$gba to no\$psx someda
in future).

**Pocketstation BIOS**
For using a copy of the original 16Kbyte BIOS: store it as file
POCKSTAT.ROM in no\$gba directory. If that file isn\'t present, the
no\$gba will use it\'s own built-in BIOS clone.

**Pocketstation Specs**
