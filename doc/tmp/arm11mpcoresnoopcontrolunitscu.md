# ARM11 MPCore - Snoop Control Unit (SCU)


**Snoop Control Unit (SCU)**
Below registers exists only once (not per CPU). However, the performance
counters are somewhat supposed to be used as two counters per CPU.

**17E00000h - SCU Control Register (R/W)**
The SCU Control Register enables the SCU and controls its behavior. It
must be accessed using a read-modify-write sequence.

```

Bit1-4: There is a mechanism that prevents all bits being cleared at the
same time.
Bit13: Before enabling SCU parity checking, all SCU tag must be
invalidated.
This register doesn\'t seem to allow to disable access to the Globa
Interrupt Distributor at 17E01000h-17E01FFFh (however, the MMU can
disable the whole 4Kbyte page).

Cache size 16KB/32KB/64KB implies 64/128/256 indexes per tag RAM
accordingly.
On Old3DS this is 00000011h. On New3DS this is 00005013h (even in Old3DS
mode). But changes to 00005003h when using fastboot\...?

Dormant mode and powered-off mode are controlled by an external power
controller.
SCU CPU Status Register bits indicate to the external power controller
which power domains can be powered down.
Before entering any other power mode than Normal, the MP11 CPU must set
its status field to signal to the SCU which mode it is about to enter
(so that the SCU can determine if it still can send coherency requests
to the CPU). The MP11 CPU then executes a WFI entry instruction. When in
WFI state, the PWRCTLOn bus is enabled and signals to the power
controller what it must do with power domains.
The SCU CPU Status Register bits are used in conjunction with internal
WFI entry signals to generate PWRCTLOn output pins.
The SCU CPU Status Register bits can also be read by a CPU exiting
low-power mode to determine its state before executing its reset setup.
MP11 CPUs status fields take PWRCTLIn values at reset, except for
nonpresent CPUs.
For nonpresent CPUs writing to this field has no effect.

Allows to invalidate the tag RAMs on a per CPU and per way basis. This
operation is atomic, that is, a write transfer to this address only
terminates when all the lines have been invalidated. This register reads
as 0.
Uh, what is a \"way\"?
