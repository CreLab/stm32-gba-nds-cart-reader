# GBA Cart e-Reader Data Format


**Data Strip Format**
The size of the data region is I\*48 bytes (I=Interleave Value, se
Dotcode Format), the first 48-byte fragment contains the Data Header,
the remaining (I-1) fragments are Data Fragments (which contain
title(s), and VPK compressed program code).

**First Strip**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Data Header  (48 bytes)                                         |
|       Main-Title   (17 bytes, or 33 bytes)                            |
|                                                                       |
|    Sub-Title(s) (3+18 bytes, or 33 bytes) (for each strip) (optional) |
|                                                                       |
|   VPK Size     (2 byte value, total length of VPK Data in ALL strips) |
|                                                                       |
|     NULL Value   (4 bytes, contained ONLY in 1st strip of GBA strips) |
|       VPK Data     (length as defined in VPK Size entry, see above)   |

- Data Checksum \[13h-14h\] is the complement (NOT) of the sum of al
halfwords in all Data Fragments, however, it\'s all done in reverse
byte order: checksum is calculated with halfwords that are read in
MSB,LSB order, and the resulting checksum is stored in MSB,LSB order in
the Header Fragment.
- Global Checksum \[2Fh\] is the complement (NOT) of the sum of the firs
2Fh bytes in the Data Header plus the sum of all Data Fragment
checksums; the Data Fragment checksums are all 30h bytes in a fragment
XORed with each other.

**Titles (3+N bytes, or N bytes)**
Titles can be 33 bytes for both Main and Sub (Format 0Eh), or Main=17
bytes and Sub=3+18 bytes (Formats 02h..05h). In the 3+N bytes form, the
first 3 bytes (24bit) are are used to display \"stats\" information i
form of \"HP: h1 ID: i1-i2-i3\", defined as:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                    |
|                                                                       |
|  0-3    h1, values 1..15 shown as "10..150", value 0 is not displayed |
|       4-6    i3, values 0..7 shown as "A..G,#"                        |
|                                                                       |
|  7-13   i2, values 0..98 shown as "01..99" values 99..127 as "A0..C8" |
|       14-18  i1, values 0..31 shown as "A..Z,-,_,{HP},.,{ID?},:"      |
|       19-22  Unknown                                                  |
|       23                                                              |
|      Disable stats (0=Show as "HP: h1 ID: i1-i2-i3", 1=Don't show it) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The N bytes portion contains the actual title, which must be terminated
by 00h (so the max length is N-1 characters, if it is shorter than N-1,
then the unused bytes are padded by further 00h\'s). The character se
is normal ASCII for non-Japan (see Region/Version entry in header), and
2-byte SHIFT-JIS for Japanese long-titles (=max 16 2-byte chars) with
values as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h          --> end-byte                                       |
|       81h,40h      --> SPC                                            |
|       81h,43h..97h --> punctuation marks                              |
|       82h,4Fh..58h --> "0..9"                                         |
|       82h,60h..79h --> "A..Z"                                         |
|       82h,81h..9Ah --> "a..z"                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

And 1-byte chars for Japanese short-titles,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00     = end-byte                                               |
|       01     = spc                                                    |
|       02..0B = 0..9                                                   |
|       0C..AF = japanese                                               |
|       B0..B4 = dash, male, female, comma, round-dot                   |
|       B5..C0 = !"%&~?/+-:.'                                           |
|       C1..DA = A..Z                                                   |
|       DB..DF = unused (blank)                                         |
|       E0..E5 = japanese                                               |
|       E6..FF = a..z                                                   |
- |       N/A    = #$()*;<=>@[\]^_`{|}                                    
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Additionally to the Main-Title, optional Sub-Titles for each strip can
be included (see Sub-Title Flag in header). If enabled, then ALL strip
titles are included in each strip (allowing to show a preview of which
strips have/haven\'t been scanned yet).
The e-Reader can display maximum of 8 sub-titles, if the data consists
of more than 8 strips, then sub-titles aren\'t displayed (so it\'d b
waste of space to include them in the dotcodes).
The Main Title gets clipped to 128 pixels width (that are, circa 22
characters), and, the e-Reader BIOS acts confused on multi-strip games
with Main Titles longer than 26 characters (so the full 33 bytes may be
used only in Japan; with 16bit charset).
If the title is empty (00h-filled), and there is only one card in the
application, then the application is started immediately. That, without
allowing the user to save it in FLASH memory.
Caution: Although shorter Titles do save memory, they do act unpleasant:
the text \"(C) P-Letter\" will be displayed at the bottom of the loadin
screen.
On Japanese/Original, 8bit sub-titles can be up to 18 characters
(without any end-byte) (or less when stats are enabled, due to limited
screen width).
