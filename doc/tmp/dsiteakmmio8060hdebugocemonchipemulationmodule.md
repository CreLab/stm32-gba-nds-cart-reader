# DSi Teak MMIO\[8060h\] - Debug (OCEM, On-chip Emulation Module)


- **MMIO\[8060h\] - OCEM Program Flow Trace Buffer (PFT), bit0-15 (R)**
- **MMIO\[8061h\] - OCEM Program Flow Trace Buffer (PFT), bit16-31 (R)**
This buffer contains addresses of the 16 most recent jump opcodes,
reading returns the oldest of those 16 addresses (or 16 random
address/page values if read after reset). One can disable buffer
- updating via MMIO\[8070h\] (eg. to avoid jumps inside of a debug handle
to be written to the buffer). There is \"buffer full\" condition tha
gets set 16 jumps after reset, and that can trap an optional buffer full
exception.

Unknown if there is any way to \"make the buffer empty\", either b
clearing the buffer, or by removing entries until it gets empty. Also,
there is no known way to read the next buffer entry, except for one
- trick: temporarily re-enable buffer updates via MMIO\[8070h\] and issu
a dummy jump; this will add a new entry, and reading will then return
the next oldest entry; by that, the buffer won\'t get empty (but, whe
ignoring the address of the dummy jump, one can extract the actual
non-dummy data from the buffer).

Break triggers upon count zero. Writing count=NNh will trap after
program counter had hit the break address NNh times (writing count=00h
will trigger immediately, without even hitting the break address).

matches can occur on things like \"mov r0,1234h\" or \"addv r0,1\" (whe
r0 becomes equal to dvm).

Maybe be \"programming model signature\" mentioned in perxteak.pe

some general purpose value to notify the debugger what kind of code is
executed?

mode bits; when entering a debug handler or so).
