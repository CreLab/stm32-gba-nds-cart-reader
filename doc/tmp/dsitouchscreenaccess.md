# DSi Touchscreen Access


The Touch Screen Controller (for lower LCD screen) is accessed via SPI
bus,
- [DS Serial Peripheral Interface Bus(./dsserialperipheralinterfacebusspi.md)
so far, it\'s same as on NDS, but the SPI touchscreen commands ar
having an entirely different format in DSi mode:
The DSi touchscreen registers are selected via a combination of a PAGE
byte and an INDEX byte. The PAGE byte is located at INDEX=00h, and it
does somewhat \'bankswitch\' the contents of INDEX=01h..7Fh. And INDE
can be incremented manually, or automatically (but, confusingly, the
manual increment doesn\'t work for reading Y coordinates).
SPI clock should be set to 4MHz for DSi Mode touchscreen access (unlike
NDS, which used 2MHz). The PENIRQ bit in port 4000136h is always zero in
DSi mode.
When reading data: Write dummy 00h-bytes in output direction.

**DSi Touchscreen PAGE:INDEX values**
The INDEX/Direction byte is written as first byte after SPI chip
select:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     Direction for following data bytes (0=Write, 1=Read)      |
|                                                                       |
|     1-7   INDEX (00h..7Fh) for following data bytes (auto-increasing) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

However, the chip has more than 128 registers, stored in multiple
pages.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       TSC[00h]=PAGE         ;<-- change page (at INDEX=0)             |
- |       TSC[PAGE:INDEX]       ;<-- access registers in select page      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Pen Down Testing**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- | if (TSC[3:09h] AND 40h)<>0 then return(not_pressed)   ;ADC Ready Flag |
|       if (T                                                           |
- | SC[3:0Eh] AND 03h)<>0 then return(not_pressed)   ;Undocumented Flags? |
|       return(pressed)                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: On NDS, this would be done by reading port 4000136h.bit6, which
isn\'t supported in DSi mode.

**X/Y Coordinate Reading**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- | touchdata[0..19] = TSC[FCh:01h..14h]     ;read page FCh, index(1..20) |
|       rawx=0, rawy=0                                                  |
|       for i=0 to 8 step 2                                             |
- |         x = touchdata[i+0]*100h+touchdata[i+1]                        |
- |         y = touchdata[i+10]*100h+touchdata[i+11]                      |
|         if (x or y) and F000h then return(not_pressed)                |
|         rawx=rawx+x, rawy=rawy+y                                      |
|       return(rawx/5, rawy/5)                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The resulting 12bit coordinates are same as on NDS (ie. they need to be
further processed using the Calibration Points from User Settings).
- Reading TSC\[FCh:01h..14h\] must be done in a single SPI transfe
- (reading them separatedly as TSC\[FCh:01h\], TSC\[FCh:02h\], etc
doesn\'t work).

**Touchscreen X/Y Coordinates**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-11   Coordinate (0..FFFh) (usually 000h when not pressed)     |
|       12-                                                             |
| 14  State (0=Pressed, 7=Released) (or sometimes also 1 or 3=Released) |
|       15                                                              |
|    State Changed (0=No, 1=Newly pressed/released; cleared after read) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bit12-14 are usually set to 7 when releasing the screen (though
sometimes they become 1 or 3 when releasing the screen, and do stay so
until newly pressing it).
Bit15 is cleared after reading (so it will be usually seen only in the
first MSB, ie. at INDEX=01h) (though maybe it can also occur elsewhere
if it becomes newly set during the SPI transfer).

**Microphone**
The microphone input was part of the TSC on NDS. In DSi mode it is
reportedly somehow changed, using a new \"CODEC\" (aka the DSi\'s newe
TSC touchscreen/sound controller).

**NDS Backwards Compatibility Mode**
The DSi hardware can emulate the NDS-style touchscreen protocol (with
X/Y/MIC channels and with additional PENIRQ flag; but without Pressure
or Temperature channels).
- [DS Touch Screen Controller (./dstouchscreencontrollertsc.md)
DSi enhanced games should implement both modes, and use the new mode on
DSi consoles, and the old mode on NDS consoles (alternately,
- CartHdr\[1BFh\].bit0=0 will activate the old mode for both NDS+DSi).
If the backwards compatibility mode isn\'t enabled, then trying to rea
the touchscreen in NDS fashion will return nothing but zeroes for all
TSC channels (and also zero for the PENIRQ bit).
