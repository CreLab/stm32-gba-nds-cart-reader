Writes to POLYGON_ATTR have no effect until next BEGIN_VTXS command.
Changes to the Light bits have no effect until lighting is re-calculated
by Normal command. The interior of Wire-frame polygons is transparent
(Alpha=0), and only the lines at the polygon edges are rendered, using a
fixed Alpha value of 31.

|       Parameter 1, Bit 0-4    Red                                     |
|       Parameter 1, Bit 5-9    Green                                   |
|       Parameter 1, Bit 10-14  Blue                                    |

The 5bit RGB values are internally expanded to 6bit RGB as follows:
X=X\*2+(X+31)/32, ie. zero remains zero, all other values are X=X\*2+1.
Aside from by using the Color command, the color can be also changed by
MaterialColor0 command (if MaterialColor0.Bit15 is set, it acts
identical as the Color Command), and by the Normal command (which
calculates the color based on light/material parameters).

**Depth Test**
The Depth Test compares the depth of the pixels of the polygon with the
depth of previously rendered polygons (or of the rear plane if there
have been none rendered yet). The new pixels are drawn if the new depth
is Less (closer to the camera), or if it is Equal, as selected by
POLYGON_ATTR.Bit14.
Normally, Depth Equal would work only exact matches (ie. if the
overlapping polygons have exactly the same coordinates; and thus have
the same rounding errors), however, the NDS hardware is allowing
\"Equal\" to have a tolerance of +/-200h (within the 24bit depth rang
of 0..FFFFFFh), that may bypass rounding errors, but it may also cause
nearby polygons to be accidently treated to have equal depth.
