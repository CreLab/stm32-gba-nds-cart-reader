+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Write/Program may not cross page-boundaries. Write/Program/Erase are
rejected during first 1..10ms after power up. The WEL bit is
automatically cleared on Power-Up, on /Reset, and on completion of
WRDI/PW/PP/PE/SE instructions. WEL is set by WREN instruction (which
must be issued before any write/program/erase instructions). Don\'t kno
how RDSR behaves when trying to write to the write-protected region?

**Communication Protocol**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Set Chip Select LOW to invoke the command                       |
|       Transmit the instruction byte                                   |
|       Transmit any parameter bytes                                    |
|       Transmit/receive any data bytes                                 |
|       Set Chip Select HIGH to finish the command                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All bytes (and 3-byte addresses) transferred most significant bit/byte
first.

**DSi \"5A32\" chip (32Kit aka 4Kbyte)**
Early DSi DWM-W015 boards did have 128Kbyte FLASH, but later boards have
custum 4Kbyte FLASH chips (these 4K chips are found on later DSi
DWM-W015 boards, and DSi DWM-W024 boards, and 3DS DWM-W028 boards). The
chips are having a 24bit address bus (needed for NDS compatibility),
and, a weird non-writeable gap within a 128Kbyte memory are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000000                                                          |
| h..0002FFh  Writeable only if /WP=HIGH (otherwise writes are ignored) |
|                                                                       |
|      000300h..01F2FFh  Not writeable (FFh-filled, writes are ignored) |
|       01F300h..01FFFFh  Writeable                                     |
|       02000                                                           |
| 0h and up    Mirrors of 0..01FFFFh (same read/write-ability as above) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

There are several part numbers: \"5A32\" (DSi), \"5K32\" (3DS), \"32B
3XH\" (3DS), and \"26FV032T\" (DSi), that chips are probably all th
same size & functionally same; most of those 4Kbyte chips have tiny
packages (except \"26FV032T\" which comes in classic large package).
