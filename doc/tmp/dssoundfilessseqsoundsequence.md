# DS Sound Files - SSEQ (Sound Sequence)


It is a converted MIDI sequence. Linked to a BANK for instruments.
SSEQ is usually found inside of SDAT files (but also exists as
standalone file, eg. 3DS Circle Pad Pro test/calib,
RomFS:\\extrapad_bcwav_LZ.bin\\\*.sseq, and 3DS Picture Picker
RomFS:\\sound\\csnd.LZ\\\*).

**Description**
A SSEQ can have at maximum 16 tracks, notes in the range of 0..127
(middle C is 60). Each quartet note has a fixed tick length of 48. Tempo
in the range of 1..240 BPM (default is 120). The SSEQ will not be played
correctly if tempo higher than 240.

The SEQ player uses ARM7\'s Timer1 for timing. The ARM7\'s 4 Timers run
at 33MHz (approximately 2\^25). The SEQ player sets Timer1 reload valu
to 2728, prescaler to F/64. So on about every 0.0052 sec
(64\*2728/33MHz) the SEQ Player will be notified (1 cycle). As a quarte
note has fixed tick value of 48, the highest tempo that SEQ Player can
handle is 240 BPM (60/(0.0052\*48)).

During each cycle, the SEQ player adds the tempo value to a variable.
Then it checks if the value exceeds 240. If it does, the SEQ player
subtracts 240 from the variable, and process the SSEQ file. Using this
method, the playback is not very precise but the difference is too small
to be noticed.

Take an example with tempo = 160 BPM, the SSEQ file is processed twice
in 3 notifications.
