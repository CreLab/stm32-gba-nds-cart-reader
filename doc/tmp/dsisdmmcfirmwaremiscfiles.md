- Entries \[0088h..009Fh\] are copied to \[2FFFD68h..2FFFD7Fh\]. Entr
- \[00A0h\] is used to construct the region-specific filename of th
Launcher (System Menu).
The RSA with Console ID means that one cannot change the region/language
stuff.
The 3DS has similar data stored in file SecureInfo_A on 3DS partition.

|       0000h 100h  RSA-OpenPGP-SHA1 across... whatever?                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Seems to be used only by DSi Shop. The RSA keys are unknown for retail
version. Also unknown WHAT the SHA1 is computed on (probably some
console and/or region IDs).
The System Updater tool (for debug version) contains both public and
private RSA keys for the file; the keys don\'t work for retail versio
though.
The OpenPGP bytes are same as for SWI 23h (but with more FFh padding
bytes due to the 100h-byte RSA size).

**FAT16:\\shared2\\0000 (2048K) (sound recorder)**
Huge 2Mbyte file with several used areas (and many zerofilled areas).
Contains a FAT12 filesystem with several voice .dat files for the Sound
Recorder of the Nintendo DSi Sound utility. Unused clusters seem to
contain garbage (maybe un-encrypted eMMC sectors).

Note: The DSi Sound utility is additionally having a 512Kbyte
private.sav file (also containing a FAT12 filesystem; although it seems
to contain only a MBR, FATs, and an empty Root directory - plus garbage
in unused clusters).

Empty folders.
