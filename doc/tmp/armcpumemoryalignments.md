# ARM CPU Memory Alignments


The CPU does NOT support accessing mis-aligned addresses (which would be
rather slow because it\'d have to merge/split that data into tw
accesses).
When reading/writing code/data to/from memory, Words and Halfwords must
be located at well-aligned memory address, ie. 32bit words aligned by 4,
and 16bit halfwords aligned by 2.

**Mis-aligned STR,STRH,STM,LDM,LDRD,STRD,PUSH,POP (forced align)**
The mis-aligned low bit(s) are ignored, the memory access goes to a
forcibly aligned (rounded-down) memory address.
For LDRD/STRD, it isn\'t clearly defined if the address must be aligne
by 8 (on the NDS, align-4 seems to be okay) (align-8 may be required on
other CPUs with 64bit databus).

**Mis-aligned LDR,SWP (rotated read)**
Reads from forcibly aligned address \"addr AND (NOT 3)\", and does the
rotate the data as \"ROR (addr AND 3)\*8\". That effect is internall
used by LDRB and LDRH opcodes (which do then mask-out the unused bits).
The SWP opcode works like a combination of LDR and STR, that means, it
does read-rotated, but does write-unrotated.

**Mis-aligned LDRH,LDRSH (does or does not do strange things)**
On ARM9 aka ARMv5 aka NDS9:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       LDRH Rd,[odd]   -->  LDRH Rd,[odd-1]        ;forced align       |
- |       LDRSH Rd,[odd]  -->  LDRSH Rd,[odd-1]       ;forced align       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

On ARM7 aka ARMv4 aka NDS7/GBA:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       LDR                                                             |
- | H Rd,[odd]   -->  LDRH Rd,[odd-1] ROR 8  ;read to bit0-7 and bit24-31 |
|                                                                       |
- |   LDRSH Rd,[odd]  -->  LDRSB Rd,[odd]         ;sign-expand BYTE value |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Mis-aligned PC/R15 (branch opcodes, or MOV/ALU/LDR with Rd=R15)**
For ARM code, the low bits of the target address should be usually zero,
otherwise, R15 is forcibly aligned by clearing the lower two bits.
For THUMB code, the low bit of the target address may/should/must be
set, the bit is (or is not) interpreted as thumb-bit (depending on the
opcode), and R15 is then forcibly aligned by clearing the lower bit.
In short, R15 will be always forcibly aligned, so mis-aligned branches
- won\'t have effect on subsequent opcodes that use R15, or \[R15+disp\
as operand.
