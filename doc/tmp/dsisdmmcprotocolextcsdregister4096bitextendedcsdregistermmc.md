**Extended CSD Register (MMC only)**
The Extended CSD register defines the card properties and selected
modes. It is 512 bytes (4096 bits) long.
The most significant 320 bytes are the Properties segment, which defines
the card capabilities and cannot be modified by the host. The lower 192
bytes are the Modes segment, which defines the configuration the card is
working in. These modes can be changed by the host by means of the
SWITCH command.

\(a\) Reserved(a) bits should read as \'0\'.
(1) Reserved(1) bits should be probably ZERO, too.
The above table is transferred \"most significant first\", which doe
probably mean that it starts with BYTE 0, not with byte 511. ALTHOUGH,
the 4-byte SEC_COUNT appears to be LITTLE-ENDIAN?
Note: JEDEC Standard No. 84-A44 contains MANY additional fields in
EXT_CSD.

**S_CMD_SET**
This field defines which command sets are supported by the card.

```

```


**SEC_COUNT (moviNAND and newer JEDEC specs only)**
The device density is calculated from the register by multiplying the
value of the register (sector count) by 512B/sector. The maximum density
possible to be indicated is thus 2 Tera bytes (minus 512 bytes)
(4,294,967,295 x 512B). The least significant byte (LSB) of the sector
- count value is the byte \[212\].

**MIN_PERF_a_b_ff**
These fields defines the overall minimum performance value for the read
and write access with different bus width and max clock frequency modes.
The value in the register is coded as follows. Other than defined values
are illegal.

**PWR_CL_ff_vvv**
These fields define the supported power classes by the card. By default,
the card has to operate at maximum frequency using 1 bit bus
configuration, within the default max current consumption, as stated in
the table below. If 4 bit/8 bits bus configurations, require increased
current consumption, it has to be stated in these registers.
By reading these registers the host can determine the power consumption
- of the card in different bus modes. Bits \[7:4\] code the curren
- consumption for the 8 bit bus configuration. Bits \[3:0\] code th
current consumption for the 4 bit bus configuration.
The PWR_52_vvv registers are not defined for 26MHz MultiMediaCards.

The measurement for max RMS current is done as average RMS current
consumption over a period of 100ms.
Max peak current is defined as absolute max value not to be exceeded at
all.
The conditions under which the power classes are defined are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       - Maximum bus frequency                                         |
|       - Maximum operating voltage                                     |
|       - Worst case functional operation                               |
|       - Worst case environmental parameters (temperature,...)         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

These registers define the maximum power consumption for any protocol
operation in data transfer mode, Ready state and Identification state.

**CARD_TYPE**
This field defines the type of the card. The only currently valid values
for this field are 0x01 and 0x03.

**EXT_CSD_REV**
Defines the fixed parameters. related to the EXT_CSD, according to its
revision.

```

|       EXT_CSD_REV   Extended CSD Revision                             |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**CMD_SET**
Contains the binary code of the command set that is currently active in
the card. It is set to \'0\' (Standard MMC) after power up and can b
changed by a SWITCH command.

**CMD_SET_REV**
Contains a binary number reflecting the revision of the currently active
command set. For Standard MMC command set it is:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Code    MMC Revisions                                           |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This field, though in the Modes segment of the EXT_CSD, is read only.

**POWER_CLASS**
This field contains the 4 bit value of the selected power class for the
card. The power classes are defined in Table. The host should be
responsible of properly writing this field with the maximum power class
it allows the card to use. The card uses this information to,
internally, manage the power budget and deliver an optimized
performance.
This field is 0 after power-on or software reset.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bits    Description                                             |
|       7-4     Reserved                                                |
|       3-0     Card power class code (See Table 5-29)                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**HS_TIMING**
This field is 0 after power-on, or software reset, thus selecting the
backwards compatibility interface timing for the card. If the host
writes 1 to this field, the card changes its timing to high speed
interface timing (refer to Chapter 5.4.8).

**BUS_WIDTH**
It is set to \'0\' (1 bit data bus) after power up and can be changed b
a SWITCH command.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Value   Bus Mode                                                |
|       0       1 bit data bus (MMC, with old 7pin connector)           |
|       1                                                               |
|      4 bit data bus (MMCplus, with SD-card-compatible 9pin connector) |
|       2       8 bit data bus (MMCplus, with special 13pin connector)  |
|       3-255   Reserved                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For detecting cards with 4bit/8bit data bus support: Switch the SD/MMC
controller to 4bit/8bit modes, and use BUSTEST_W and BUSTEST_R to test
if the card sends a proper response, see
<https://www.mikrocontroller.net/attachment/101561/AN_MMCA050419.pdf>
Note: The SD/MMC controller in the DSi supports 1bit/4bit modes only (no
8bit mode). For the DSi\'s onboard eMMC it\'s safe to assume 4bit bein
supported, however, external MMC cards do require detecting 4bit
support.

**ERASED_MEM_CONT (moviNAND) (but, RESERVED in newer JEDEC specs!)**
This Field defines the content of an explicitly erased memory range.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Value   Erased Memory content                                   |
|       00h     Erased memory range shall be '0'                        |
|       01h     Erased memory range shall be '1'                        |
|       02h-FFh Reserved                                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Looks like a mis-definition, since value 00h should have been kept
reserved for cards that do not specify whether they set erased bits to 0
or 1.
