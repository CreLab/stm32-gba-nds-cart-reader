# 3DS Files - NCCH Format


**NCCH (Nintendo Content Container Header) (in .app files)**
This format is used to store the content of any installed title. There
are two NCCH variants:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       CXI aka CTR Executable Image, with ARM11 code                   |
|       CFA aka CTR File Archive, with data only                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The CXI/CFA format is structured in the following order:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       NCCH                                                            |
| header                                                  (unencrypted) |
|       Exh                                                             |
| eader (CXI only)                                          (encrypted) |
|       Logo                                                            |
| (5.0.0-11 and up)                                       (unencrypted) |
|       SDK S                                                           |
| trings (aka plain binary region) (optional, CXI only)   (unencrypted) |
|       Exe                                                             |
| FS filesystem (optional) - ARM11 code (CXI), icon/banner  (encrypted) |
|       Rom                                                             |
| FS filesystem (optional) - Used for external file storage (encrypted) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

User-executable Tools (eg. System Settings) do have two NCCH .app files:
One with the program .code, and one with the data manual. Internal
System Modules (eg. MCU driver) have only one .app file (with program
.code, without manual).

All of the hashes stored in this NCCH header are over the cleartext
data.
Given offsets are based on the start of the file.

**Extended header**
The extended header contains additional information
regarding/restricting access control.
- [3DS Files - NCCH Extended Header](./3dsfilesncchextendedheader.md)

**Logo**
- [3DS Files - NCCH Logo](./3dsfilesncchlogo.md)

**Plain binary region (SDK strings) (CXI only)**
This region contains several zero-terminated ASCII strings (usually in
- form \"\[SDK+Blah:Blahblah\]\",00h).

Uh, all that blurb seems to say that\... the SDK string is irrelevant 
and if there\'s anything relevant, then it\'s the descriptor, bu
not/never the SDK string?

**ExeFS and RomFS (Filesystems)**
- [3DS Files - NCCH ExeFS](./3dsfilesncchexefs.md)
- [3DS Files - NCCH RomFS](./3dsfilesncchromfs.md)
Both ExeFS and RomFS are designed as read-only filesystems (in lack of a
FAT, changing filesizes would require to relocate all following files).

**Encryption (for Exheader, ExeFS, and RomFS)**
- [3DS Files - NCCH Encryption](./3dsfilesncchencryption.md)

**Region Locking**
The region-locking info checked by home menu is stored in the \"icon\
file in ExeFS.

**RSA**
CFAs NCCH header signature uses a fixed RSA public key.
CXIs NCCH header signature uses the RSA public key stored in the
Exheader (whereof, that part of the Exheader is signed via another RSA
key).

**Tools**
ctrtool - (CMD) (Windows/Linux) Parsing and decrypting (debug only) NCCH
files
