# 3DS Files - NCCH Format


### NCCH (Nintendo Content Container Header) (in .app files)
This format is used to store the content of any installed title. There are two NCCH variants:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       CXI aka CTR Executable Image, with ARM11 code                   |
|       CFA aka CTR File Archive, with data only                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The CXI/CFA format is structured in the following order:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       NCCH header                                                  (unencrypted) |
|       Exheader (CXI only)                                          (encrypted)   |
|       Logo (5.0.0-11 and up)                                       (unencrypted) |
|       SDK Strings (aka plain binary region) (optional, CXI only)   (unencrypted) |
|       ExeFS filesystem (optional) - ARM11 code (CXI), icon/banner  (encrypted)   |
|       RomFS filesystem (optional) - Used for external file storage (encrypted)   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

User-executable Tools (eg. System Settings) do have two NCCH .app files: One with the program .code, and one with the data manual. Internal System Modules (eg. MCU driver) have only one .app file (with program .code, without manual).

All of the hashes stored in this NCCH header are over the cleartext data.
Given offsets are based on the start of the file.

### Extended header
The extended header contains additional information regarding/restricting access control.
- [3DS Files - NCCH Extended Header](./3dsfilesncchextendedheader.md)

### Logo
- [3DS Files - NCCH Logo](./3dsfilesncchlogo.md)

### Plain binary region (SDK strings) (CXI only)
This region contains several zero-terminated ASCII strings (usually in form \"\[SDK+Blah:Blahblah\]\",00h).

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       "The version used for the "FIRMWARE" tag (what?) is the kernel/FIRM      |
|       version, this version can also be stored in the exheader "kernel release |
|       version" ARM11 kernel descriptor field. As of 2.2.0-X the NATIVE_FIRM    |
|       kernels check the CXI exheader "kernel release version" field, if it is  |
|       stored in the CXI exheader. If the kernel/FIRM version specified by this |
|       field is higher than the version of the running NATIVE_FIRM, the kernel  |
|       will return error-code D9001413h."                                       |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Uh, all that blurb seems to say that\... the SDK string is irrelevant - and if there\'s anything relevant, then it\'s the descriptor, but not/never the SDK string?

### ExeFS and RomFS (Filesystems)
- [3DS Files - NCCH ExeFS](./3dsfilesncchexefs.md)
- [3DS Files - NCCH RomFS](./3dsfilesncchromfs.md)
Both ExeFS and RomFS are designed as read-only filesystems (in lack of a FAT, changing filesizes would require to relocate all following files).

### Encryption (for Exheader, ExeFS, and RomFS)
- [3DS Files - NCCH Encryption](./3dsfilesncchencryption.md)

### Region Locking
The region-locking info checked by home menu is stored in the \"icon\" file in ExeFS.

### RSA
CFAs NCCH header signature uses a fixed RSA public key.
CXIs NCCH header signature uses the RSA public key stored in the Exheader (whereof, that part of the Exheader is signed via another RSA key).

### Tools
ctrtool - (CMD) (Windows/Linux) Parsing and decrypting (debug only) NCCH files
