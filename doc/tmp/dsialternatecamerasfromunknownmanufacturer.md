# DSi Alternate Cameras from Unknown Manufacturer


Device A0h/E0h appear to be cameras from an alternate manufacturer. DSi
games are supporting these devices, but as by now, there aren\'t any DS
consoles known to be actually fitted with these cameras.
The camera type & manufacturer are still unknown. Below initialization
data is containing some characterstic info that should allow to identify
them. For example, register 03h appears to be bank-switching the other
registers.

**unknown_cam_get_chip_id:**
Reading an 8bit value from index 00h (in any bank?) seems to return some
Chip ID, at least the DSi is reading that register before initialization
(despite of reading it, the DSi does appear to ignore that value
though).
Note: On a DSi with Aptina cameras, trying to read anything from I2C
devices A0h/E0h does just return FFh-bytes.

**Formatting Note**
- Below tables consist of \"Index,Length,Data\[Length\]\" entries.
