Used to set/clear the password (=to change the password), or to
lock/unlock the card (=to log out/log in). If the password exists, then
the default state on power-up is Locked (user is logged out).
In locked state, the card will accept only \"Basic Commands\" (class 0)
plus CMD16,40,42, plus ACMD41,42. Observe that this will prevent some
initialization commands (for example, switching to 4bit bus via
SET_BUS_WIDTH (ACMD6) isn\'t possible on locked cards).
The password is stored in a 128bit PWD register, so password can be max
16 bytes long. The PWDS_LEN value can be max 32 bytes (when sending
old+new password). The length of the current/old password is stored in
an 8bit PWD_LEN register (though due to the above limit, that \"8bit\
value can be in range 0..16 only; PWD_LEN=0 means that there is no
password, which is somewhat equivalent to what happens when setting the
CLR_PWD bit?).
PWD Notes:
Related CSR status bits are: CARD_IS_LOCKED and LOCK_UNLOCK_FAILED.
Presence of the locking feature is indicated by the CCC \"class 7\" bi
in CSD register.
Many SD cards are internally containing separate controller and memory
chips, so it might be quite easy to bypass the locking by desoldering
one of those chips.
