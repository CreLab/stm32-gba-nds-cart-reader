# SIO General-Purpose Mode


In this mode, the SIO is \'misused\' as a 4bit bi-directional paralle
port, each of the SI,SO,SC,SD pins may be directly controlled, each can
be separately declared as input (with internal pull-up) or as output
signal.

**4000134h - RCNT (R) - SIO Mode, usage in GENERAL-PURPOSE Mode (R/W)**
Interrupts can be requested when SI changes from HIGH to LOW, as General
Purpose mode does not require a serial shift clock, this interrupt may
be produced even when the GBA is in Stop (low power standby) state.

SI should be always used as Input to avoid problems with other hardware
which does not expect data to be output there.

**4000128h - SIOCNT - SIO Control, not used in GENERAL-PURPOSE Mode**
This register is not used in general purpose mode. That is, the separate
bits of SIOCNT still exist and are read- and/or write-able in the same
manner as for Normal, Multiplay, or UART mode (depending on SIOCNT Bit
12,13), but are having no effect on data being output to the link port.
