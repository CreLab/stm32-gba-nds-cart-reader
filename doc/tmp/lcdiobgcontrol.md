In case that some or all BGs are set to same priority then BG0 is having
the highest, and BG3 the lowest priority.

In \'Text Modes\', the screen size is organized as follows: The scree
consists of one or more 256x256 pixel (32x32 tiles) areas. When Size=0:
only 1 area (SC0), when Size=1 or Size=2: two areas (SC0,SC1 either
horizontally or vertically arranged next to each other), when Size=3:
four areas (SC0,SC1 in upper row, SC2,SC3 in lower row). Whereas SC0 is
defined by the normal BG Map base address (Bit 8-12 of BGxCNT), SC1 uses
same address +2K, SC2 address +4K, SC3 address +6K. When the screen is
scrolled it\'ll always wraparound.

In \'Rotation/Scaling Modes\', the screen size is organized as follows
only one area (SC0) of variable size 128x128..1024x1024 pixels
(16x16..128x128 tiles) exists. When the screen is rotated/scaled (or
scrolled?) so that the LCD viewport reaches outside of the
background/screen area, then BG may be either displayed as transparent
or wraparound (Bit 13 of BGxCNT).
