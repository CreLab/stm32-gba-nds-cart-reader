# DSi SD/MMC Protocol: OCR Register (32bit Operation Conditions Register)


CMD1 (MMC) and ACMD41 (SD) are intended to exchange OCR information.
That is, the OCR parameter bits should indicate the host conditions (eg.
for DSi: 40100000h, ie. bit20=3.3V supply, and bit30=HCS support for
High Capacity carts with more than 2GBytes). The OCR response may then
return something like 007f8000h when busy, and 807f8000h when ready
(bit20 indicating the voltage being actually supported, bit30 indicating
if it\'s High Capacity card, and bit31 indicating if the card is ready 
switched from \"idle\" to \"ready\" state).
Cards do usually send at least one response with bit31=0 (busy), one
should repeat sending CMD1/ACMD51 until bit31=1 (ready).
Note: All card(s) on the bus will respond to CMD1/ACMD51: with the
response bits ANDed together (thus returning nonsense in bit30=HCS when
actually sharing the same bus for multiple cards).
Note: The card switches to \"ina\" state if the voltage in param bit
isn\'t supported.

below)
Sends host capacity support information and activates the card\'
initialization process. HCS is effective when card receives SET_IF_COND
command.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

SPI Mode Response: R1 (without extra Data transfer? use READ_OCR
instead?)
Sends host capacity support information (HCS) and asks the accessed card
to send its operating condition register (OCR) content in the response
on the CMD line. HCS is effective when card receives SET_IF_COND command
(uh, but IF_COND should be set BEFORE setting OP_COND?).
Sends request to switch to 1.8V signaling (S18R).
- Reserved bit shall be set to \'0\'. CCS bit is assigned to OCR\[30\].
XPC controls the maximum power in the default speed mode of SDXC card.

**CMD58 - SD/MMC - SPI-ONLY (not Non-SPI Mode) - READ_OCR**

MMC=Reserved, SD=READ_EXTR_MULTI)!

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**OCR register**
The 32-bit operation conditions register stores the VDD voltage profile
of the non UHS-II card and VDD1 voltage profile of the UHS-II card.
Additionally, this register includes status information bits. One status
bit is set if the card power up procedure has been finished. This
register includes another status bit indicating the card capacity status
after set power up status bit. The OCR register shall be implemented by
the cards.
The 32-bit operation conditions register stores the VDD voltage profile
of the card.
Bit 7 of OCR is newly defined for Dual Voltage Card and set to 0 in
default. If a Dual Voltage Card does not receive CMD8, OCR bit 7 in the
response indicates 0, and the Dual Voltage Card which received CMD8,
sets this bit to 1.

```

The supported voltage range is coded as shown in Table 5-1. A voltage
range is not supported if the corresponding bit value is set to LOW. As
long as the card is busy, the corresponding bit (31) is set to LOW.
VDD Voltage Window of OCR indicates VDD1 voltage range in case of UHS-II
Card.
UHS-II Card Status bit is added in Bit 29 to indicate whether the card
supports UHS-II Interface. Non UHS-II Card sets Bit 29 to 0 and UHS-II
Card sets Bit 29 to 1. This bit is not affected by whether VDD2 is
supplied or not.
