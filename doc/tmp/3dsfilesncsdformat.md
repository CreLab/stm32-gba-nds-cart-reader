# 3DS Files - NCSD Format


NCSD format is used for internal eMMC storage & for 3DS ROM cartridges. The NCSD can contain up to 8 partitions.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      For eMMC, the partitions are:                                                  |
|       Part Type     Content                                                         |
|       0    MBR      DSi MBR (with two FAT filesystems, FAT16+FAT12)                 |
|       1    GBA-SAVE GBA savegame (temporary storage, used on power-off in GBA mode) |
|       2    FIRM     Firmware partition (firm0)                                      |
|       3    FIRM     Firmware partition (firm1) (backup copy, same as above)         |
|       4    MBR      3DS MBR (with one FAT filesystem, FAT16)                        |
|       5-7  -        Unused                                                          |
|      For 3DS ROM Cartridges (aka CCI images), the partitions are:                   |
|       Part Type     Content                                                         |
|       0    NCCH     Executable Content (CXI)                                        |
|       1    NCCH     E-Manual (CFA)                                                  |
|       2    NCCH     Download Play Child container (CFA) (if any)                    |
|       3-5  -        Unused                                                          |
|       6    NCCH     New3DS System Update Data (CFA) (if any) ;\aka firmware updates 
|       7    NCCH     Old3DS System Update Data (CFA)          ;/                     |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Blurb
There are two known specialisations of the NCSD container format:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       - The CTR Cart Image (CCI) format (CCI is the format of game ROM images) |
|       - The 3DS' raw NAND format                                               |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

CTR System Update (CSU) is a variant of CCI, where the only difference is in the file extension (uh, that is the file extension of a ROM-image that needs to be copied to a dev flashcard or so?). This is used with developer System Updates and associated Tools.
The format of partitions can be determined from the partition FS flags (normally these are zero for CCI/CSU NCSD Images) (uh, what/where is \"FS flags\"?).

### NCSD header

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 100h    RSA-2048 SHA-256 signature of the NCSD header (including MBR!)   |
|       100h 4       ID "NCSD"                                                        |
|       104h 4       Size of the NCSD image (in media units)                          |
|       108h 8  ?    Media ID                                                         |
|       110h 8*1     Partitions Type  (0=NCCH or Unused, 1=MBR, 3=FIRM, 4=GBA-SAVE)   |

|       120h 8*(4+4) Partitions Offset & Size (in media units)                        |
|      For eMMC:                                                                      |
|       160h 25h Zerofilled                                                           |

|                  (key-data used for this keyslot is console-unique).                |
|      For ROM carts:                                                                 |
|       160h 20h Exheader SHA-256 hash (uh, really?)                     (usually 0)  |
|       180h 4   Additional header size (uh, does that mean "Exheader"?) (usually 0)  |
|       184h 4   Sector zero offset (whatever, in whatever units, usually 0)          |
|       188h ..  Partition Flags (uh, why called "flags" and why "partition"?)        |
|       188h 1   Backup Write Wait Time (The time to wait to write save to backup     |
|                  after the card is recognized (0-255 seconds)). NATIVE_FIRM loads   |
|                  this flag from the gamecard NCSD header starting with 6.0.0-11.    |
|       189h 1   unknown, maybe related to below "Save Crypto"?                       |

|       1FEh 1   Support for this was implemented with 9.6.0-X FIRM.                  |
|                  Bit0=1 enables using bits 1-2, it's unknown what these two         |
|                  bits are actually used for (the value of these two bits get        |
|                  compared with some other value during NCSD                         |
|                  verification/loading).                                             |
|                  This appears to enable a new, likely hardware-based,               |
|                  antipiracy check on cartridges.                                    |
|       1FFh 1   Support for this was implemented with 9.6.0-X FIRM, see below        |
|                  regarding save crypto.                                             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### NCSD Signature
The RSA pubk used for gamecard NCSD is stored in ITCM (what/wherefrom?).
The RSA pubk used for NAND NCSD is stored in \"Process9 .(ro)data instead of ITCM\". Uh, shouldn\'t that key (also?) be in bootrom?

### Partition Flags (In Terms of Save Crypto Determination) (uh, Save what?)
Note: Byte 01h,03h,07h do probably refer to NCSD\[189h,18Bh,18Fh\].
Note: flag\[1,3,7\] do probably ALSO refer to NCSD\[189h,18Bh,18Fh\].
Note: partitionflag\[1,3,7\] do MAYBE ALSO refer to NCSD\[189h,18Bh,18Fh\]?

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Byte   Description                                                        |
|       01h    Starting with 6.0.0-11 NATIVE_FIRM will use this flag to determine |
|                the gamecard savegame keyY method, when flag[3] is set.          |
|                00h = 2.0.0-2 hashed keyY,                                       |
|                01h = new keyY method implemented with 6.0.0-11.                 |
|                0Ah = implemented with 9.3.0-X. On Old3DS this is identical to   |
|                  the 2.2.0-4 crypto. On New3DS this is identical to the 2.2.0-4 |
|                  crypto, except with New3DS-only gamecard savedata keyslots.    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Starting with 9.6.0-X FIRM, Process9 now sets \<savecrypto_stateval\> to partitionflag\[1\] + \<the u8 value from NCSD+0x1FF\>, instead of just setting it to partitionflag\[1\].

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       03h    Support for this flag was implemented in NATIVE_FIRM with 2.0.0-2.    |
|                When this flag is set the hashed gamecard savegame keyY method is   |
|                used, this likely still uses the repeating-CTR however.             |
|                With 6.0.0-11 the system will determine the gamecard savegame keyY  |
|                method via flag[1], instead of just using the hashed keyY via this  |
|                flag.                                                               |
|       07h    This flag enables using the hashed gamecard savegame keyY method,     |
|                support for this flag was implemented in NATIVE_FIRM with 2.2.0-4.  |
|                All games with the NCSD image finalized since 2.2.0-4 (and contains |
|                2.2.0-4+ in the system update partition) have this flag set, this   |
|                flag also enables using new CTR method as well.                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Starting with 9.6.0-X FIRM, Process9 will just write val0 to a state field then return 0, instead of returning an error when the save crypto type isn\'t recognized. This was the \*only\* actual functionality change in the Old3DS Process9 function for gamecard savedata crypto init.

### Card Info Header - uh, maybe this is the \"Exheader\" aka \"Additional header\"?

|      read MULTIPLE blocks from 1000h upwards?)                                     |
|      Below says something about NTR cmd 90h or CTR cmd 90h or A2h, but that        |
|      refers to getting the 32bit Chip ID, not to header data at 1200h and up.      |
|       1200h  200h  CardDeviceReserved1                                             |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note that a particular(=which?) flashcard vendor puts what many(=who?) refer to as \"private headers\"(=what?) here in place of actual development card information. This(=which?) header is constituted(=whut?) by a cartridge-unique Id obtained from pxi:ps9::GetRomId(=what?) and the title-unique cart ID (identical for all carts of the same title; can be retrieved using the NTR gamecard protocol command 90h or through the CTR protocol commands 90h or A2h) (uh, actually, that is the Chip ID, not a \"title-unique cart ID\" thing).
