# 3DS Files - NCSD Format


NCSD format is used for internal eMMC storage & for 3DS ROM cartridges.
The NCSD can contain up to 8 partitions.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      For eMMC, the partitions are:                                    |
|       Part Type     Content                                           |
|       0    MBR      DSi MBR (with two FAT filesystems, FAT16+FAT12)   |
|       1    GBA                                                        |
| -SAVE GBA savegame (temporary storage, used on power-off in GBA mode) |
|       2    FIRM     Firmware partition (firm0)                        |
|                                                                       |
| 3    FIRM     Firmware partition (firm1) (backup copy, same as above) |
|       4    MBR      3DS MBR (with one FAT filesystem, FAT16)          |
|       5-7  -        Unused                                            |
|      For 3DS ROM Cartridges (aka CCI images), the partitions are:     |
|       Part Type     Content                                           |
|       0    NCCH     Executable Content (CXI)                          |
|       1    NCCH     E-Manual (CFA)                                    |
|       2    NCCH     Download Play Child container (CFA) (if any)      |
|       3-5  -        Unused                                            |
|       6    NCC                                                        |
| H     New3DS System Update Data (CFA) (if any) ;\aka firmware updates 
|       7    NCCH     Old3DS System Update Data (CFA)          ;/       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Blurb**
There are two known specialisations of the NCSD container format:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       - T                                                             |
| he CTR Cart Image (CCI) format (CCI is the format of game ROM images) |
|       - The 3DS' raw NAND format                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

CTR System Update (CSU) is a variant of CCI, where the only difference
is in the file extension (uh, that is the file extension of a ROM-image
that needs to be copied to a dev flashcard or so?). This is used with
developer System Updates and associated Tools.
The format of partitions can be determined from the partition FS flags
(normally these are zero for CCI/CSU NCSD Images) (uh, what/where is
\"FS flags\"?).

**NCSD Signature**
The RSA pubk used for gamecard NCSD is stored in ITCM
(what/wherefrom?).
The RSA pubk used for NAND NCSD is stored in \"Process9 .(ro)dat
instead of ITCM\". Uh, shouldn\'t that key (also?) be in bootrom?

**Partition Flags (In Terms of Save Crypto Determination) (uh, Save
what?)**
- Note: Byte 01h,03h,07h do probably refer to NCSD\[189h,18Bh,18Fh\].
- Note: flag\[1,3,7\] do probably ALSO refer to NCSD\[189h,18Bh,18Fh\].
- Note: partitionflag\[1,3,7\] do MAYBE ALSO refer t
- NCSD\[189h,18Bh,18Fh\]?

Starting with 9.6.0-X FIRM, Process9 now sets \<savecrypto_stateval\> t
- partitionflag\[1\] + \<the u8 value from NCSD+0x1FF\>, instead of jus
- setting it to partitionflag\[1\].

|    With 6.0.0-11 the system will determine the gamecard savegame keyY |
|                                                                       |

|     2.2.0-4+ in the system update partition) have this flag set, this |
|                flag also enables using new CTR method as well.        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Starting with 9.6.0-X FIRM, Process9 will just write val0 to a state
field then return 0, instead of returning an error when the save crypto
type isn\'t recognized. This was the \*only\* actual functionalit
change in the Old3DS Process9 function for gamecard savedata crypto
init.

**Card Info Header - uh, maybe this is the \"Exheader\" aka \"Additiona
header\"?**

Note that a particular(=which?) flashcard vendor puts what many(=who?)
refer to as \"private headers\"(=what?) here in place of actua
development card information. This(=which?) header is
constituted(=whut?) by a cartridge-unique Id obtained from
pxi:ps9::GetRomId(=what?) and the title-unique cart ID (identical for
all carts of the same title; can be retrieved using the NTR gamecard
protocol command 90h or through the CTR protocol commands 90h or A2h)
(uh, actually, that is the Chip ID, not a \"title-unique cart ID\
thing).
