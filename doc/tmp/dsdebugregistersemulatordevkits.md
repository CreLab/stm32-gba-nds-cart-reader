**No\$gba Emulator Pseudo I/O Ports (no\$gba) (GBA,NDS9,NDS7)**

Note: Above ports can be disabled via the \"Debug I/O\" option i
no\$gba setup.

**Ensata Emulator Pseudo I/O Ports (NDS9)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|   4000640h (32bit) ;aka CLIPMTX_RESULT (mis-used to invoke detection) |
|       4000006h (16bit) ;aka VCOUNT (mis-used to get detection result) |
|       4FFF010h (32bit) ;use to initialize/unlock/reset something      |
|       4FFF000                                                         |
| h (8bit)  ;debug message character output (used when Ensata detected) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Ensata detection works by mis-using CLIPMTX_RESULT and VCOUNT
registers:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       [40006                                                          |
| 40h]=2468ACE0h      ;CLIPMTX_RESULT (on real hardware it's read-only) |
|       if                                                              |
- | ([4000006h] AND 1FFh)=10Eh ;VCOUNT (on real hardware it's 000h..106h) |
- |         [4FFF010h]=13579BDFh        ;\initialize/reset something      
- |         [4FFF010h]=FDB97531h        ;/                                |
|         Ensata=true                                                   |
|       else                                                            |
|         Ensata=false                                                  |
|       endif                                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Once when a commercial game has detected Ensata, it stops communicating
with the ARM7, and instead it does seem to want to communicate with the
Ensata executable (which has little to do with real NDS hardware). Ie.
aside from \"unlocking\" port 4FFF000h, it does also \"lock\" access t
the ARM7 hardware (like sound, touchscreen, RTC, etc).

**ISD (Intelligent Systems Debugger or so) I/O Ports**
The ISD ports seem to be real (non-emulated) debugging ports, mapped to
the GBA Slot region at 8000000h-9FFFFFFh, and used to output text
messages, and possible also other debugging stuff.
There are appear to be two variants: nitroemu and cgbemu (the latter
appears to be dating back to old 8bit CGB hardware; which was apparently
still used for the NDS two hardware generations later).

**NDS Devkit**
In Nintendo\'s devkit, debug messages are handled in fil
\"os_printf.c\", this file detects the available hardware/software base
- debug I/O ports, and redirects the \[OS_PutString\] vector to th
corresponding string_out function (eg. to OS_PutStringAris for writing a
00h-terminated string to port 4FFF000h). With some minimal efforts, this
could be redirected to the corresponding no\$gba debug I/O ports.
