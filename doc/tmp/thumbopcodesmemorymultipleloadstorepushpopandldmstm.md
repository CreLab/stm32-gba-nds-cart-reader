**THUMB.14: push/pop registers**

|           0: PUSH {Rlist}{LR}   ;store in memory, decrements SP (R13) |
|                                                                       |
|          1: POP  {Rlist}{PC}   ;load from memory, increments SP (R13) |

|       8      PC/LR Bit (0-1)                                          |
|               0: No                                                   |
|               1: PUSH LR (R14), or POP PC (R15)                       |

In THUMB mode stack is always meant to be \'full descending\', ie. PUS
is equivalent to \'STMFD/STMDB\' and POP to \'LDMFD/LDMIA\' in AR
mode.
Examples:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      PUSH {R0-R3}     ;push R0,R1,R2,R3                               |
|      PUSH {R0,R2,LR}  ;push R0,R2,LR                                  |
|      POP  {R4,R7}     ;pop R4,R7                                      |
|      POP  {R2-R4,PC}  ;pop R2,R3,R4,PC                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: When calling to a sub-routine, the return address is stored in LR
register, when calling further sub-routines, PUSH {LR} must be used to
save higher return address on stack. If so, POP {PC} can be later used
to return from the sub-routine.
POP {PC} ignores the least significant bit of the return address
(processor remains in thumb state even if bit0 was cleared), when
intending to return with optional mode switch, use a POP/BX combination
(eg. POP {R3} / BX R3).
ARM9: POP {PC} copies the LSB to thumb bit (switches to ARM if bit0=0).
Return: No flags affected, SP adjusted, registers loaded/stored.
Execution Time: nS+1N+1I (POP), (n+1)S+2N+1I (POP PC), or (n-1)S+2N
(PUSH).

**THUMB.15: multiple load/store**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15-12  Must be 1100b for this type of instructions              |
|       11     Opcode (0-1)                                             |
|               0: STMIA Rb!,{Rlist}   ;store in memory, increments Rb  |
|               1: LDMIA Rb!,{Rlist}   ;load from memory, increments Rb |
|       10-8   Rb - Base register (modified) (R0-R7)                    |
|       7-0    Rlist - List of Registers     (R7..R0)                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Both STM and LDM are incrementing the Base Register.
The lowest register in the list (ie. R0, if it\'s in the list) i
stored/loaded at the lowest memory address.
Examples:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      STMIA R7!,{R0-R2}  ;store R0,R1,R2                               |
|      LDMIA R0!,{R1,R5}  ;store R1,R5                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No flags affected, Rb adjusted, registers loaded/stored.
Execution Time: nS+1N+1I for LDM, or (n-1)S+2N for STM.

**Strange Effects on Invalid Rlist\'s**
Empty Rlist: R15 loaded/stored (ARMv4 only), and Rb=Rb+40h (ARMv4-v5).
Writeback with Rb included in Rlist: Store OLD base if Rb is FIRST entry
in Rlist, otherwise store NEW base (STM/ARMv4), always store OLD base
(STM/ARMv5), no writeback (LDM/ARMv4/ARMv5; at this point, THUMB opcodes
work different than ARM opcodes).
