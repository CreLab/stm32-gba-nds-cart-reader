# DSi Cartridge Header


**Old NDS Header Entries**
The first 180h bytes of the DSi Header are essentially same as on NDS:
- [DS Cartridge Header](./dscartridgeheader.md)
New/changed entries in DSi carts are:

```

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

NDS carts (that don\'t use DSi features, but are manufactured after DS
release) contain these extra entries:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      (012h)1    Unitcode (must be 00h for non-DSi carts)              |
|      (020h)16                                                         |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All other entries at 160h..FFFh are zerofilled in non-DSi carts.

**Changed ARM9/ARM7 areas (and new ARM9i/ARM7i areas)**
NDS allowed ARM9 or ARM7 to occupy about 3.8MB of main RAM. On DSi this
is restriced to 2.5MB for ARM9 and 0.25MB for ARM7, ie. 2.75MB in total,
this restriction applies even in NDS-mode, thus making DSi not fully
backwards compatible with NDS games (officially licensed NDS titles
hopefully don\'t conflict with that new restriction). In DSi mode, on
can additionally load 2.5MB for ARM9i and 1MB for ARM7i, ie. 6.25MB in
total for all four areas.
The DSi loading is a bit complicated, the areas are first loaded to
DEDICATED areas:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       A                                                               |
| RM9  2004000h..227FFFFh (siz=27C000h) (for NDS mode: 2000000h and up) |
|       ARM7  2380000h..23BFFFFh (siz=40000h)                           |
|       ARM9i 2400000h..267FFFFh (siz=280000h)                          |
|       ARM7i 2E80000h..2F87FFFh (siz=108000h)                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If the cart header does match with those DEDICATED areas then the data
is left in place, otherwise it gets relocated to GENERAL areas (shortly
before jumping to the entrypoint). The GENERAL areas are allowed to be:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|  Main  2000000h..2FFC000h (excluding bootstrap at 23FEE00h..23FF000h) |
|                                                                       |
|  WRAM  3000000h..380F000h (excluding bootstrap at 3FFF600h..3FFF800h) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The GENERAL areas may not overlap with another DEDICATED area (eg. ARM7
cannot be relocated to the ARM9+ARM9i+ARM7i areas). Concerning the 16K
at 2000000h..2003FFFh: ARM7+ARM9i+ARM7i aren\'t allow to use that, bu
ARM9 seems to be relocatable to that address (usually that shouldn\'t b
done as it would destroy some DSi system variables).
ARM9i+ARM7i areas can have \"Size\" and \"ROM offset\" set to zero (bu
still need to have a valid nonzero \"RAM Load address\").
ARM9/ARM7 entrypoints MUST be within ARM9/ARM7 area respectively (NDS
allowed entrypoints being anywhere).

**DSiware/System Utilities**
Files saved on SD card or internal eMMC memory are having the same
header as ROM carts, with some differences:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|   No need for NDS backwards compatibility (since DSiware is DSi only) |
|       Entry 3A0h can be zero-filled (in LAUNCHER)                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- DSiware files are usually marked as \[012h\]=03h=DSi (exceptions are th
DS Download Play and PictoChat utilities, which are marked
- \[012h\]=00h=NDS, since they are actually running in NDS mode (ye
having at least two DSi-specific features: 1st is allowing to reboot
into DSi menu via Powerman SPI, 2nd is requiring enabled wifi channels
in 2FFFCFAh)).

**SHA1-HMAC**
The SHA1-HMAC\'s in cart header and Digest tables are SHA1 checksum
with a 40h-byte HMAC key (values 21h, 06h, C0h, DEh, BAh, \..., 24h)
the key is contained in the Launcher, and it\'s also stored in most DS
cartridges (probably used for verifying Digest values when loading
additional data after booting). The key can be used for verifying
checksums, but (due to the RSA signature) not for changing them. See
BIOS chapter for SHA1/HMAC pseudo code.

**RSA-SHA1**
The RSA-SHA1 value is a normal SHA1 (not SHA1-HMAC) across header
- entries \[000h..DFFh\], the 20-byte value is padded to 127-byte siz
(01h, 105xFFh, 00h, followed by the 20 SHA1 bytes). It can be decrypted
(via SWI 22h) using the 80h-byte RSA public keys located in ARM9BIOS
(note that there are at least four different RSA keys, one is used for
games, and others for system files), and can be then verfied against the
SHA1 checksum (computed via SWI 27h).
- [BIOS RSA Functions (./biosrsafunctionsdsionly.md)
The private key needed for encryption is unknown, which is unfortunately
preventing to boot unlicensed (homebrew) software.

- **Modcrypt (AES-CTR) (optional, carthdr\[220h..22Fh\] can be al
zero)**
Modcrypt is a new additional way of encrypting parts of the NDS ROM
executable binary modules using AES CTR. It is mostly being used to
encrypt the ARM9i and ARM7i binaries. DSi cartridges are usually having
only the ARM9i binary encrypted (as area 1), while NAND based
applications have both the ARM9i and ARM7i binaries encrypted (as area 1
and 2).
The initial AES Counter value (IV) is:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Modcrypt                                                        |
- |  Area 1 IV[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the ARM9 SHA1-HMAC   [300h..30Fh] |
|       Modcrypt                                                        |
- |  Area 2 IV[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the ARM7 SHA1-HMAC   [314h..323h] |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The AES key depends of flags in the cartridge header:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |      IF header[01Ch].Bit1=0                                           |
|       None (modcrypt disabled)                                        |
|      ELSEIF                                                           |
- | header[01Ch].Bit2 OR header[1BFh].Bit7 THEN (probably for prototypes) |
|       Debug KE                                                        |
- | Y[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the header                    [000h..00Fh] |
|      ELSE (commonly used for retail software)                         |
|       Retail K                                                        |
- | EY_X[0..7]: Fixed 8-byte ASCII string                    ("Nintendo") |
|       Retail K                                                        |
- | EY_X[8..B]: The 4-byte gamecode, forwards                [00Ch..00Fh] |
|       Retail K                                                        |
- | EY_X[C..F]: The 4-byte gamecode, backwards               [00Fh..00Ch] |

- | EY_Y[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the ARM9i SHA1-HMAC        [350h..35Fh] |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Above does describe how modcrypted areas should look like. However,
there are several circumstances where the firmware can\'t actuall
decrypt that areas\...
Theoretically, the modcrypt areas can span over any of the ARM9i/ARM7i
and ARM9/ARM7 areas (in practice, cartridges should never use modcrypt
for the ARM9/ARM7 areas because NDS consoles would leave them
undecrypted; that restriction doesn\'t apply to DSiware though).
Theoretically, a large modcrypt area could contain several data areas,
but the launcher does decrypt only the first matching data area (areas
are processed in order ARM9, ARM7, ARM9i, ARM7i). Moreover, matching
data areas must be INSIDE of the modcrypt area (ie. the data area must
be same size, or smaller than the modrypt area) (whereas, the launcher
is weirdly rounding-up the data size to a multiple of 20h-bytes when
checking that matches) (as a side-effect, each data area can be
decrypted starting with \"IV+0\", rather than needin
\"IV+(offset_within_modcrypt_area/10h\").
Theoretically, AES decryption could be done byte-wise, however, the AES
hardware is doing it in 10h-byte chunks, unknown if the launcher does
require 10h-byte alignments; however, in fact, the launcher seems to be
rounding the modcrypt END address to 20h-byte boundary - so it\'s safes
to stick with 20h-byte aligned start+size values for modcrypt areas, as
well as for corresponding data areas.
Note: The size of the modcrypt areas can exceed the AES hardware\'s siz
limit of max FFFF0h bytes (eg. in DSi Sound utility), in such cases
decryption must be split to smaller AES chunks; with manually increased
IV.
Modcrypt area 1 and 2 can overlap each other (whereas, it doesn\'
matter which of them is processed first, since the encryption/decryption
is done by XORing).
Note: The ARM9 code for modcrypt/data areas is at 26A6BB8h in Launcher
v1.4E.

- **Digests (optional, carthdr\[1E0h..207h\] can be all zero)**
The NDS format has been extended with a hash tree to verify the entire
contents of an NDS ROM. The NDS ROM is divided into sectors, and each
sector will be hashed and have its hash stored in the digest sector
hashtable. The size of a sector is defined in the header aswell.
Furthermore, the sector hashtable is partitioned and hashed again to
form block hashes. This block hashtable is hashed again into a single
hash called the digest master hash. These hashtables can be used to
verify that the sectors of a NDS ROM have not been tampered with, since
the integrity of a sector hash can be verified by a block hash, which in
turn can be verified by the master hash. And this hash is part of the
header, which is signed with RSA.
The sector hashtable reaches over the NTR and TWL regions,
respectively.

**Cartridge Protocol**
The DSi cartridge protocol is same as on NDS; with one new command (3Dh)
for unlocking DSi specific memory regions. For details,
