# DSi Cartridge Header


### Old NDS Header Entries
The first 180h bytes of the DSi Header are essentially same as on NDS:
- [DS Cartridge Header](./dscartridgeheader.md)
New/changed entries in DSi carts are:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       012h 1    Unitcode (00h=NDS, 02h=NDS+DSi, 03h=DSi) (bit1=DSi)                |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

NDS carts (that don\'t use DSi features, but are manufactured after DSi release) contain these extra entries:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      (012h)1    Unitcode (must be 00h for non-DSi carts)                            |
|      (020h)16   Changed ARM9/ARM7 areas (DSi-in-NDS-mode more restricted than NDS)  |
|       088h 4    Unknown (B8h,4Bh,00h,00h) (similar as in DSi carts)                 |
|       1BFh 1    Flags (40h=RSA+TwoHMACs, 60h=RSA+ThreeHMACs)                        |
|       33Ch 14   HMAC for Icon/Title (only if [1BFh]=60h)      ;as Whitelist Phase 3 |

|       38Ch 14   HMAC for OverlayARM9+NitroFAT (zero if no overlay)      ;as Phase 2 |
|       F80h 128  RSA signature                                                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All other entries at 160h..FFFh are zerofilled in non-DSi carts.

### Changed ARM9/ARM7 areas (and new ARM9i/ARM7i areas)
NDS allowed ARM9 or ARM7 to occupy about 3.8MB of main RAM. On DSi this is restriced to 2.5MB for ARM9 and 0.25MB for ARM7, ie. 2.75MB in total, this restriction applies even in NDS-mode, thus making DSi not fully backwards compatible with NDS games (officially licensed NDS titles hopefully don\'t conflict with that new restriction). In DSi mode, one can additionally load 2.5MB for ARM9i and 1MB for ARM7i, ie. 6.25MB in total for all four areas.
The DSi loading is a bit complicated, the areas are first loaded to DEDICATED areas:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ARM9  2004000h..227FFFFh (siz=27C000h) (for NDS mode: 2000000h and up) |
|       ARM7  2380000h..23BFFFFh (siz=40000h)                                  |
|       ARM9i 2400000h..267FFFFh (siz=280000h)                                 |
|       ARM7i 2E80000h..2F87FFFh (siz=108000h)                                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If the cart header does match with those DEDICATED areas then the data is left in place, otherwise it gets relocated to GENERAL areas (shortly before jumping to the entrypoint). The GENERAL areas are allowed to be:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Main  2000000h..2FFC000h (excluding bootstrap at 23FEE00h..23FF000h) |
|       WRAM  3000000h..380F000h (excluding bootstrap at 3FFF600h..3FFF800h) |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The GENERAL areas may not overlap with another DEDICATED area (eg. ARM7 cannot be relocated to the ARM9+ARM9i+ARM7i areas). Concerning the 16K at 2000000h..2003FFFh: ARM7+ARM9i+ARM7i aren\'t allow to use that, but ARM9 seems to be relocatable to that address (usually that shouldn\'t be done as it would destroy some DSi system variables).
ARM9i+ARM7i areas can have \"Size\" and \"ROM offset\" set to zero (but still need to have a valid nonzero \"RAM Load address\").
ARM9/ARM7 entrypoints MUST be within ARM9/ARM7 area respectively (NDS allowed entrypoints being anywhere).

### DSiware/System Utilities
Files saved on SD card or internal eMMC memory are having the same header as ROM carts, with some differences:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       No need for NDS backwards compatibility (since DSiware is DSi only) |
|       Entry 3A0h can be zero-filled (in LAUNCHER)                         |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

DSiware files are usually marked as \[012h\]=03h=DSi (exceptions are the DS Download Play and PictoChat utilities, which are marked \[012h\]=00h=NDS, since they are actually running in NDS mode (yet having at least two DSi-specific features: 1st is allowing to reboot into DSi menu via Powerman SPI, 2nd is requiring enabled wifi channels in 2FFFCFAh)).

### SHA1-HMAC
The SHA1-HMAC\'s in cart header and Digest tables are SHA1 checksums with a 40h-byte HMAC key (values 21h, 06h, C0h, DEh, BAh, \..., 24h), the key is contained in the Launcher, and it\'s also stored in most DSi cartridges (probably used for verifying Digest values when loading additional data after booting). The key can be used for verifying checksums, but (due to the RSA signature) not for changing them. See BIOS chapter for SHA1/HMAC pseudo code.

### RSA-SHA1
The RSA-SHA1 value is a normal SHA1 (not SHA1-HMAC) across header entries \[000h..DFFh\], the 20-byte value is padded to 127-byte size (01h, 105xFFh, 00h, followed by the 20 SHA1 bytes). It can be decrypted (via SWI 22h) using the 80h-byte RSA public keys located in ARM9BIOS (note that there are at least four different RSA keys, one is used for games, and others for system files), and can be then verfied against the SHA1 checksum (computed via SWI 27h).

The private key needed for encryption is unknown, which is unfortunately preventing to boot unlicensed (homebrew) software.

### Modcrypt (AES-CTR) (optional, carthdr\[220h..22Fh\] can be all zero)
Modcrypt is a new additional way of encrypting parts of the NDS ROM executable binary modules using AES CTR. It is mostly being used to encrypt the ARM9i and ARM7i binaries. DSi cartridges are usually having only the ARM9i binary encrypted (as area 1), while NAND based applications have both the ARM9i and ARM7i binaries encrypted (as area 1 and 2).
The initial AES Counter value (IV) is:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Modcrypt Area 1 IV[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the ARM9 SHA1-HMAC   [300h..30Fh] |
|       Modcrypt Area 2 IV[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the ARM7 SHA1-HMAC   [314h..323h] |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The AES key depends of flags in the cartridge header:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      IF header[01Ch].Bit1=0                                                         |
|       None (modcrypt disabled)                                                      |
|      ELSEIF header[01Ch].Bit2 OR header[1BFh].Bit7 THEN (probably for prototypes)   |
|       Debug KEY[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the header                    [000h..00Fh] |
|      ELSE (commonly used for retail software)                                       |
|       Retail KEY_X[0..7]: Fixed 8-byte ASCII string                    ("Nintendo") |
|       Retail KEY_X[8..B]: The 4-byte gamecode, forwards                [00Ch..00Fh] |
|       Retail KEY_X[C..F]: The 4-byte gamecode, backwards               [00Fh..00Ch] |
|       Retail KEY_Y[0..F]: First 16 bytes of the ARM9i SHA1-HMAC        [350h..35Fh] |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Above does describe how modcrypted areas should look like. However, there are several circumstances where the firmware can\'t actually decrypt that areas\...
Theoretically, the modcrypt areas can span over any of the ARM9i/ARM7i and ARM9/ARM7 areas (in practice, cartridges should never use modcrypt for the ARM9/ARM7 areas because NDS consoles would leave them undecrypted; that restriction doesn\'t apply to DSiware though).
Theoretically, a large modcrypt area could contain several data areas, but the launcher does decrypt only the first matching data area (areas are processed in order ARM9, ARM7, ARM9i, ARM7i). Moreover, matching data areas must be INSIDE of the modcrypt area (ie. the data area must be same size, or smaller than the modrypt area) (whereas, the launcher is weirdly rounding-up the data size to a multiple of 20h-bytes when checking that matches) (as a side-effect, each data area can be decrypted starting with \"IV+0\", rather than needing \"IV+(offset_within_modcrypt_area/10h\").
Theoretically, AES decryption could be done byte-wise, however, the AES hardware is doing it in 10h-byte chunks, unknown if the launcher does require 10h-byte alignments; however, in fact, the launcher seems to be rounding the modcrypt END address to 20h-byte boundary - so it\'s safest to stick with 20h-byte aligned start+size values for modcrypt areas, as well as for corresponding data areas.
Note: The size of the modcrypt areas can exceed the AES hardware\'s size limit of max FFFF0h bytes (eg. in DSi Sound utility), in such cases decryption must be split to smaller AES chunks; with manually increased IV.
Modcrypt area 1 and 2 can overlap each other (whereas, it doesn\'t matter which of them is processed first, since the encryption/decryption is done by XORing).
Note: The ARM9 code for modcrypt/data areas is at 26A6BB8h in Launcher v1.4E.

### Digests (optional, carthdr\[1E0h..207h\] can be all zero)
The NDS format has been extended with a hash tree to verify the entire contents of an NDS ROM. The NDS ROM is divided into sectors, and each sector will be hashed and have its hash stored in the digest sector hashtable. The size of a sector is defined in the header aswell. Furthermore, the sector hashtable is partitioned and hashed again to form block hashes. This block hashtable is hashed again into a single hash called the digest master hash. These hashtables can be used to verify that the sectors of a NDS ROM have not been tampered with, since the integrity of a sector hash can be verified by a block hash, which in turn can be verified by the master hash. And this hash is part of the header, which is signed with RSA.
The sector hashtable reaches over the NTR and TWL regions, respectively.

### Cartridge Protocol
The DSi cartridge protocol is same as on NDS; with one new command (3Dh) for unlocking DSi specific memory regions. For details,
