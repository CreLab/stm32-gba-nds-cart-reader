### MCU\[05h-07h\] - MCU Firmware update unlock sequence ;ARRAY\[4003h\] (R/W)
Updating MCU Firmware FLASH is done by writing 4003h bytes to MCU\[05h and up\]. The I2C transfer timings (and flash write timings) are automatically handled via SCL-hold. The upload takes about 2 seconds, and the console does then reboot the MCU\... the backlights stay on, but I2C MCU access seems to be non-functional\... for a while?
The first three bytes must be 6Ah,68h,6Ch (aka \"jhl\"), if the 3rd write does match (and 1st-2nd write were also correct), then the MCU switches to receiving a 4000h-byte firmware image. The image consists of two blocks:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       1000h bytes written to flash address 0000h-0FFFh (4K)           |
|       3000h bytes written to flash address 2000h-4FFFh (12K)          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For error checking, the image must contain three identical 9-byte \"HH:MM:SS\",00h timestamps:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0FF6h..0FFEh - 1st timestamp                                    |
|       2000h..2008h - 2nd timestamp                                    |
|       4FF6h..4FFEh - 3rd timestamp                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The first byte of the timestamp must be other than FFh, and the third byte must be \":\".
BUG: The 1st/3rd timestamp are checked before applying the firmware update, but 2nd timestamp isn\'t checked until AFTER applying it (then causing blinking red power led, and requiring the reflash via UART pin).
- [3DS I2C MCU - RL78 Flash Programming via UART](./3dsi2cmcurl78flashprogrammingviauart.md)
Uploading bugged code may also require reflashing via UART (the UART stuff is handled in ROM, and works safely even if the whole flash is erased).

### Firmware Inner Workings
The MCU contains a RL78 processor with reflashable firmware.

### Firmware Nocash MCU Patches
Code Execution in Battery RAM:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       MCU[05h-07h] = "exc"  --> Battery RAM code gets executed immediately        |
|       MCU[05h-07h] = "exq"  --> Battery RAM code gets enqueued as callback        |
|       Before execution, use MCU[61h] to upload code to Battery RAM, the RAM       |
|       can be also used to store parameters and return values, you may want to     |
|       restore the original RAM content after execution for not confusing the OS.  |
|       The ROM/RAM memory map varies for different MCU firmware versions, however, |
|       the patched firmware provides useful ROM/RAM addresses in below tables,     |
|       code should either use relative jumps, or addresses from those tables.      |

### Firmware Image/Dumping
A copy of the firmware-image can be found in the System Modules folder,

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3ds:\title\00040130\00001f02\content\000000vv.app ;MCU                  
|       3ds:\title\00040130\20001f02\content\000000vv.app ;MCU New3DS           
|       3ds:\title\00040130\00001f03\content\000000vv.app ;MCU Safe mode        
|       3ds:\title\00040130\20001f03\content\000000vv.app ;MCU Safe mode New3DS 
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The .app file contains a .code file with ARM11 code (and the MCU firmware somewhere inside of that .code file, usually at file offset A078h or A07Ch; starting with the 3-byte unlock code (\"jhl\"), followed by the 4000h-byte firmware image).
Dumping the firmware directly from FLASH memory isn\'t supported. However, one could patch the firmware, and then dump the backup of the old version (that will destroy the backup of the yet older version though).
