# GBA Cartridge Header


The first 192 bytes at 8000000h-80000BFh in ROM are used as cartridge
header. The same header is also used for Multiboot images at
2000000h-20000BFh (plus some additional multiboot entries at 20000C0h
and up).

**Header Overview**

|   4     JOYBUS Entry Pt. (32bit ARM branch opcode, eg. "B joy_start") |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: With all entry points, the CPU is initially set into system mode.

**000h - Entry Point, 4 Bytes**
Space for a single 32bit ARM opcode that redirects to the actual
startaddress of the cartridge, this should be usually a \"B \<start\>\
instruction.
Note: This entry is ignored by Multiboot slave GBAs (in fact, the entry
is then overwritten and redirected to a separate Multiboot Entry Point,
as described below).

**004h..09Fh - Nintendo Logo, 156 Bytes**
Contains the Nintendo logo which is displayed during the boot procedure.
Cartridge won\'t work if this data is missing or modified.
In detail: This area contains Huffman compression data (but excluding
the compression header which is hardcoded in the BIOS, so that it\'d b
probably not possible to hack the GBA by producing de-compression buffer
overflows).
A copy of the compression data is stored in the BIOS, the GBA will
compare this data and lock-up itself if the BIOS data isn\'t exactly th
same as in the cartridge (or multiboot header). The only exception are
the two entries below which are allowed to have variable settings in
some bits.

**09Ch Bit 2,7 - Debugging Enable**
This is part of the above Nintendo Logo area, and must be commonly set
to 21h, however, Bit 2 and Bit 7 may be set to other values.
When both bits are set (ie. A5h), the FIQ/Undefined Instruction handler
in the BIOS becomes unlocked, the handler then forwards these exceptions
to the user handler in cartridge ROM (entry point defined in 80000B4h,
see below).
Other bit combinations currently do not seem to have special functions.

**09Eh Bit 0,1 - Cartridge Key Number MSBs**
This is part of the above Nintendo Logo area, and must be commonly set
to F8h, however, Bit 0-1 may be set to other values.
During startup, the BIOS performs some dummy-reads from a stream of
pre-defined addresses, even though these reads seem to be meaningless,
they might be intended to unlock a read-protection inside of commercial
cartridge. There are 16 pre-defined address streams - selected by a 4bit
key number - of which the upper two bits are gained from 800009Eh Bit
0-1, and the lower two bits from a checksum across header bytes
09Dh..0B7h (bytewise XORed, divided by 40h).

**0A0h - Game Title, Uppercase Ascii, max 12 characters**
Space for the game title, padded with 00h (if less than 12 chars).

**0ACh - Game Code, Uppercase Ascii, 4 characters**
This is the same code as the AGB-UTTD code which is printed on the
package and sticker on (commercial) cartridges (excluding the leading
\"AGB-\" part).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       U  Unique Code          (usually "A" or "B" or special meaning) |
|       TT Short Title          (eg. "PM" for Pac Man)                  |
|       D                                                               |
| Destination/Language (usually "J" or "E" or "P" or specific language) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The first character (U) is usually \"A\" or \"B\", in detail:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       A  Normal game; Older titles (mainly 2001..2003)                |
|       B  Normal game; Newer titles (2003..)                           |
|                                                                       |
| C  Normal game; Not used yet, but might be used for even newer titles |
|       F  Famicom/Classic NES Series (software emulated NES games)     |
|       K  Yoshi and Koro Koro Puzzle (acceleration sensor)             |
|       P  e                                                            |
| -Reader (dot-code scanner) (or NDS PassMe image when gamecode="PASS") |
|                                                                       |
|   R  Warioware Twisted (cartridge with rumble and z-axis gyro sensor) |
|       U  Boktai 1 and 2 (cartridge with RTC and solar sensor)         |
|       V  Drill Dozer (cartridge with rumble)                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The second/third characters (TT) are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Usual                                                           |
| ly an abbreviation of the game title (eg. "PM" for "Pac Man") (unless |
|       tha                                                             |
| t gamecode was already used for another game, then TT is just random) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The fourth character (D) indicates Destination/Language:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       J                                                               |
| Japan             P  Europe/Elsewhere   F  French          S  Spanish |
|       E  USA/English       D  German             I  Italian           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**0B0h - Maker code, Uppercase Ascii, 2 characters**
Identifies the (commercial) developer. For example, \"01\"=Nintendo.

**0B2h - Fixed value, 1 Byte**
Must be 96h.

**0B3h - Main unit code, 1 Byte**
Identifies the required hardware. Should be 00h for current GBA models.

**0B4h - Device type, 1 Byte**
Normally, this entry should be zero. With Nintendo\'s hardware debugge
Bit 7 identifies the debugging handlers entry point and size of DACS
(Debugging And Communication System) memory: Bit7=0: 9FFC000h/8MBIT
DACS, Bit7=1: 9FE2000h/1MBIT DACS. The debugging handler can be enabled
in 800009Ch (see above), normal cartridges do not have any memory (nor
any mirrors) at these addresses though.

**0B5h - Reserved Area, 7 Bytes**
Reserved, zero filled.

**0BCh - Software version number**
Version number of the game. Usually zero.

**0BDh - Complement check, 1 Byte**
Header checksum, cartridge won\'t work if incorrect. Calculate as such:
- chk=0:for i=0A0h to 0BCh:chk=chk-\[i\]:next:chk=(chk-19h) and 0FFh

**0BEh - Reserved Area, 2 Bytes**
Reserved, zero filled.

Below required for Multiboot/slave programs only. For Multiboot, the
above 192 bytes are required to be transferred as header-block (loaded
to 2000000h-20000BFh), and some additional header-information must be
located at the beginning of the actual program/data-block (loaded to
20000C0h and up). This extended header consists of Multiboot Entry
point(s) which must be set up correctly, and of two reserved bytes which
are overwritten by the boot procedure:

**0C0h - Normal/Multiplay mode Entry Point**
This entry is used only if the GBA has been booted by using Normal or
Multiplay transfer mode (but not by Joybus mode).
Typically deposit a ARM-32bit \"B \<start\>\" branch opcode at thi
location, which is pointing to your actual initialization procedure.

**0C4h (BYTE) - Boot mode**
The slave GBA download procedure overwrites this byte by a value which
is indicating the used multiboot transfer mode.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Value  Expl.                                                    |
|       01h    Joybus mode                                              |
|       02h    Normal mode                                              |
|       03h    Multiplay mode                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Typically set this byte to zero by inserting DCB 00h in your source.
Be sure that your uploaded program does not contain important program
code or data at this location, or at the ID-byte location below.

**0C5h (BYTE) - Slave ID Number**
If the GBA has been booted in Normal or Multiplay mode, this byte
becomes overwritten by the slave ID number of the local GBA (that\'d b
always 01h for normal mode).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Value  Expl.                                                    |
|       01h    Slave #1                                                 |
|       02h    Slave #2                                                 |
|       03h    Slave #3                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Typically set this byte to zero by inserting DCB 00h in your source.
When booted in Joybus mode, the value is NOT changed and remains the
same as uploaded from the master GBA.

**0C6h..0DFh - Not used**
Appears to be unused.

**0E0h - Joybus mode Entry Point**
If the GBA has been booted by using Joybus transfer mode, then the entry
point is located at this address rather than at 20000C0h. Either put
your initialization procedure directly at this address, or redirect to
the actual boot procedure by depositing a \"B \<start\>\" opcode her
(either one using 32bit ARM code). Or, if you are not intending to
support joybus mode (which is probably rarely used), ignore this entry.
