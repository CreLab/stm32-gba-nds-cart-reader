# GBA Cartridge Header


The first 192 bytes at 8000000h-80000BFh in ROM are used as cartridge header. The same header is also used for Multiboot images at 2000000h-20000BFh (plus some additional multiboot entries at 20000C0h and up).

### Header Overview

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Address Bytes Expl.                                                         |

|       0B4h    1     Device type      (usually 00h) (bit7=DACS/debug related)      |
|       0B5h    7     Reserved Area    (should be zero filled)                      |
|       0BCh    1     Software version (usually 00h)                                |
|       0BDh    1     Complement check (header checksum, required!)                 |
|       0BEh    2     Reserved Area    (should be zero filled)                      |
|       --- Additional Multiboot Header Entries ---                                 |
|       0C0h    4     RAM Entry Point  (32bit ARM branch opcode, eg. "B ram_start") |
|       0C4h    1     Boot mode        (init as 00h - BIOS overwrites this value!)  |
|       0C5h    1     Slave ID Number  (init as 00h - BIOS overwrites this value!)  |

|       0E0h    4     JOYBUS Entry Pt. (32bit ARM branch opcode, eg. "B joy_start") |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: With all entry points, the CPU is initially set into system mode.

### 000h - Entry Point, 4 Bytes
Space for a single 32bit ARM opcode that redirects to the actual startaddress of the cartridge, this should be usually a \"B \<start\>\" instruction.
Note: This entry is ignored by Multiboot slave GBAs (in fact, the entry is then overwritten and redirected to a separate Multiboot Entry Point, as described below).

### 004h..09Fh - Nintendo Logo, 156 Bytes
Contains the Nintendo logo which is displayed during the boot procedure. Cartridge won\'t work if this data is missing or modified.
In detail: This area contains Huffman compression data (but excluding the compression header which is hardcoded in the BIOS, so that it\'d be probably not possible to hack the GBA by producing de-compression buffer overflows).
A copy of the compression data is stored in the BIOS, the GBA will compare this data and lock-up itself if the BIOS data isn\'t exactly the same as in the cartridge (or multiboot header). The only exception are the two entries below which are allowed to have variable settings in some bits.

### 09Ch Bit 2,7 - Debugging Enable
This is part of the above Nintendo Logo area, and must be commonly set to 21h, however, Bit 2 and Bit 7 may be set to other values.
When both bits are set (ie. A5h), the FIQ/Undefined Instruction handler in the BIOS becomes unlocked, the handler then forwards these exceptions to the user handler in cartridge ROM (entry point defined in 80000B4h, see below).
Other bit combinations currently do not seem to have special functions.

### 09Eh Bit 0,1 - Cartridge Key Number MSBs
This is part of the above Nintendo Logo area, and must be commonly set to F8h, however, Bit 0-1 may be set to other values.
During startup, the BIOS performs some dummy-reads from a stream of pre-defined addresses, even though these reads seem to be meaningless, they might be intended to unlock a read-protection inside of commercial cartridge. There are 16 pre-defined address streams - selected by a 4bit key number - of which the upper two bits are gained from 800009Eh Bit 0-1, and the lower two bits from a checksum across header bytes 09Dh..0B7h (bytewise XORed, divided by 40h).

### 0A0h - Game Title, Uppercase Ascii, max 12 characters
Space for the game title, padded with 00h (if less than 12 chars).

### 0ACh - Game Code, Uppercase Ascii, 4 characters
This is the same code as the AGB-UTTD code which is printed on the package and sticker on (commercial) cartridges (excluding the leading \"AGB-\" part).

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       U  Unique Code          (usually "A" or "B" or special meaning)          |
|       TT Short Title          (eg. "PM" for Pac Man)                           |
|       D  Destination/Language (usually "J" or "E" or "P" or specific language) |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The first character (U) is usually \"A\" or \"B\", in detail:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       A  Normal game; Older titles (mainly 2001..2003)                          |
|       B  Normal game; Newer titles (2003..)                                     |
|       C  Normal game; Not used yet, but might be used for even newer titles     |
|       F  Famicom/Classic NES Series (software emulated NES games)               |
|       K  Yoshi and Koro Koro Puzzle (acceleration sensor)                       |
|       P  e-Reader (dot-code scanner) (or NDS PassMe image when gamecode="PASS") |
|       R  Warioware Twisted (cartridge with rumble and z-axis gyro sensor)       |
|       U  Boktai 1 and 2 (cartridge with RTC and solar sensor)                   |
|       V  Drill Dozer (cartridge with rumble)                                    |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The second/third characters (TT) are:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Usually an abbreviation of the game title (eg. "PM" for "Pac Man") (unless |
|       that gamecode was already used for another game, then TT is just random)   |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The fourth character (D) indicates Destination/Language:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       J  Japan             P  Europe/Elsewhere   F  French          S  Spanish |
|       E  USA/English       D  German             I  Italian                    |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### 0B0h - Maker code, Uppercase Ascii, 2 characters
Identifies the (commercial) developer. For example, \"01\"=Nintendo.

### 0B2h - Fixed value, 1 Byte
Must be 96h.

### 0B3h - Main unit code, 1 Byte
Identifies the required hardware. Should be 00h for current GBA models.

### 0B4h - Device type, 1 Byte
Normally, this entry should be zero. With Nintendo\'s hardware debugger Bit 7 identifies the debugging handlers entry point and size of DACS (Debugging And Communication System) memory: Bit7=0: 9FFC000h/8MBIT DACS, Bit7=1: 9FE2000h/1MBIT DACS. The debugging handler can be enabled in 800009Ch (see above), normal cartridges do not have any memory (nor any mirrors) at these addresses though.

### 0B5h - Reserved Area, 7 Bytes
Reserved, zero filled.

### 0BCh - Software version number
Version number of the game. Usually zero.

### 0BDh - Complement check, 1 Byte
Header checksum, cartridge won\'t work if incorrect. Calculate as such:
chk=0:for i=0A0h to 0BCh:chk=chk-\[i\]:next:chk=(chk-19h) and 0FFh

### 0BEh - Reserved Area, 2 Bytes
Reserved, zero filled.

Below required for Multiboot/slave programs only. For Multiboot, the above 192 bytes are required to be transferred as header-block (loaded to 2000000h-20000BFh), and some additional header-information must be located at the beginning of the actual program/data-block (loaded to 20000C0h and up). This extended header consists of Multiboot Entry point(s) which must be set up correctly, and of two reserved bytes which are overwritten by the boot procedure:

### 0C0h - Normal/Multiplay mode Entry Point
This entry is used only if the GBA has been booted by using Normal or Multiplay transfer mode (but not by Joybus mode).
Typically deposit a ARM-32bit \"B \<start\>\" branch opcode at this location, which is pointing to your actual initialization procedure.

### 0C4h (BYTE) - Boot mode
The slave GBA download procedure overwrites this byte by a value which is indicating the used multiboot transfer mode.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Value  Expl.                                                    |
|       01h    Joybus mode                                              |
|       02h    Normal mode                                              |
|       03h    Multiplay mode                                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Typically set this byte to zero by inserting DCB 00h in your source.
Be sure that your uploaded program does not contain important program code or data at this location, or at the ID-byte location below.

### 0C5h (BYTE) - Slave ID Number
If the GBA has been booted in Normal or Multiplay mode, this byte becomes overwritten by the slave ID number of the local GBA (that\'d be always 01h for normal mode).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Value  Expl.                                                    |
|       01h    Slave #1                                                 |
|       02h    Slave #2                                                 |
|       03h    Slave #3                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Typically set this byte to zero by inserting DCB 00h in your source.
When booted in Joybus mode, the value is NOT changed and remains the same as uploaded from the master GBA.

### 0C6h..0DFh - Not used
Appears to be unused.

### 0E0h - Joybus mode Entry Point
If the GBA has been booted by using Joybus transfer mode, then the entry point is located at this address rather than at 20000C0h. Either put your initialization procedure directly at this address, or redirect to the actual boot procedure by depositing a \"B \<start\>\" opcode here (either one using 32bit ARM code). Or, if you are not intending to support joybus mode (which is probably rarely used), ignore this entry.
