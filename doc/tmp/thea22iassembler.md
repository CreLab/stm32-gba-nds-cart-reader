# The A22i Assembler


**Online Assembler**
In the debuggers code window, you can directly enter assembler
instructions and modify the program code. The assembler input box shows
up automatically when typing the first character of the new
instruction.
The most basic purpose would be to overwrite an opcode by typing
\"NOP\", but you could also enter any other instruction, such like \"AD
R0,R0,4\" when having debug info (.sym file) loaded, you may also us
labels as parameters, eg. \"B mainloop\". The pseudo opcode \"LD
Rd,=Imm\" can be used only under certain circumstances:
- [Using LDR Rd,=Imm in OnlineAssembler](./usingldrrdimminonlineassembler.md)
Note: Aside from translating machine code instructions, the assembler
input box can be also used to change the value of CPU registers, by
typing \"r0=12345678\", or \"sp=3007FF0\" for example. For curiosity, i
also parses simple commands such like: run, reload, help, exit, date,
etc.

**Source Code Assembler**
The assembler can be also used to assemble source code files, by using
the Assemble File function in Utility menu. This function has been
mostly implemented for my own pleasure, and because I didn\'t wanted t
install thirdparty tools on my computer. It\'s having some nic
features, but it\'s also lacking some possibly important functions (se
below).

**A22i Advantages**
It\'s easy to use, very fast, produces ready-for-use debug info .sy
files, it understands official ARM syntax, as well as more reasonable
cleaned-up syntax, and also different assembler dialects, directives,
and numeric formats, it can be used directly from inside of the debugger
(and from inside of the editor), and vice-versa: it\'s able call th
editor in case of assembly errors.

**A22i Disadvantages**
The main disadvantage is that A22i isn\'t supporting macros (yet).

**A22i is a Matter of Taste**
If you want to use linkers, make files, project files, header files,
command files, resource files, script files, libraries, high level
languages, strip commands, object files, and cathode ray tube (crt)
files - forget about it!
A22i translates a source code file into a binary file, not more, not
less.

**Sample Code**
For a source code example, have a look at the Magic Floor game at the
no\$gba webpage, the package includes the binary, source code, wit
comments, and .sym debug info file.
