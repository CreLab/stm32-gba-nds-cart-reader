# DS Wifi Unused Registers


**Wifi WS0 and WS1 Regions in NDS7 I/O Space**
Wifi hardware occupies two 32K slots, but most of it is filled with
unused or duplicated regions. The timings (waitstates) for WS0 and WS1
are initialized in WIFIWAITCNT (by firmware).

Wifi Registers (recommended 4808000h-4808FFFh) appear more stable in
WS1?
Wifi RAM (recommended 4804000h-4805FFFh) appears more stable in WS0?

**Unused Ports (Original NDS)**
Aside from those ports listed in the Wifi I/O Map, all other ports in
range 4808000h..4808FFFh are unused. On the original DS, reading from
these ports returns FFFFh.

**Unused Ports (NDS-Lite)**
Reading from unused I/O ports acts as PASSIVE mirror of W_RXBUF_RD_DATA.
Exceptions are: Ports 4808188h, and 48082D8h..48082E6h; which always
return 0000h.

**Unused Memory (Original NDS)**
Unused Wifi Memory is at 2000h..3FFFh. On the original DS, reading from
that region returns FFFFh.

**Unused Memory (NDS-Lite)**
Reading from unused memory acts as PASSIVE mirror of WifiRAM (ie.
reading from it returns the value being most recently read from
4000h..5FFFh) (that not affected by indirect WifiRAM reads via
W_RXBUF_RD_DATA) (and, that not affected by writes to wifi memory,
including writes that do overwrite the most recent read value) (and,
that only if WifiRAM is properly enabled, ie. Port 4808220h.Bits0-1
should be 0).
Moreover, certain addresses are additionally ORed with mirrored I/O
Ports. That addresses are:

| 2030h, 2044h, 2056h, 2080h, 2090h, 2094h, 2098h, 209Ch, 20A0h, 20A4h, |
|                                                                       |
| 20A8h, 20AAh, 20B0h, 20B6h, 20BAh, 21C0h, 2208h, 2210h, 2244h, 31D0h, |
|       31D2h, 31D4h, 31D6h, 31D8h, 31DAh, 31DCh, 31DEh.                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For example, 2044h is a PASSIVE mirror of WifiRAM, ORed with an ACTIVE
mirror of W_RANDOM (Port 044h). Note that some mirrors are at
2000h-2FFFh, and some at 3000h-3FFFh. The W_CMD_STAT mirrors are PASSIVE
(that, in unused memory region only) (in normal port-mirror regions like
1000h-1FFF, W_CMD_STAT mirrors are ACTIVE).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Notes: The mirror to W_RXBUF_RD_DATA is a passive mirror.
The DS-Lite mirror at 21Ch consists of several ports ORed with each
other (known components are Ports 010h and 05Ch, but there seem to be
even more values ORed with it).

**Port Mirror Regions**
The Wifi Port region at 000h..FFFh is mirrored to 1000h..1FFFh,
6000h..6FFFh, and 7000h..7FFFh. Many of that mirrored ports are PASSIVE
mirrors. Eg. reading from 1060h (mirror of Port 060h, W_RXBUF_RD_DATA)
returns the old W_RXBUF_RD_DATA value (but without loading a new value
from Wifi RAM, and without incrementing W_RXBUF_RD_ADDR). However, other
registers, like W_RANDOM do have ACTIVE mirrors.
