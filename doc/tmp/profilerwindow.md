# Profiler Window


The Profiler Window (Alt+P key in debug mode) displays execution time
and number of calls of all executed procedures. The window is split into
Tree, Path, and List tabs. Double-clicking an item in a tab moves the
debuggers code window to the selected procedure.

**Profiler Tree Tab**
Displays all executed procedures with number of calls and execution
time, presented as tree view; sub-routines show up as child branches.
Useful to find out which procedures have been called how long and at
which location(s).

**Profiler Path Tab**
Displays the current branch of the profiler tree - including any
(nested) interrupt branch(es), the currently executed procedure shows up
at the bottom. The path is similar to all return addresses on the
various isr/irq/svc stacks (and in the LR register) being merged into a
single \"stack\".

**Profiler List Tab**
Displays all executed procedures, the number of calls, and execution
time in separate columns. The table can be sorted by clicking on the
column headers.

**Clock Cycle Values**
The clock cycles can be optionally shown as total number of cycles
(since the game was started, or the profiler list has been cleared), or
as medium number of cycles per call, or as medium number of cycles per
second (the GBA runs at 16,777,216 cycles per second).
Also, clock cycles can be either shown with or without cycles being
spent in sub-routines (optionally including or excluding cycles in
Halt/IntrWait sub-routines).

**IRQs and DMAs**
By default, IRQs and sound/video DMAs are shown as root entries in tree.
If desired, the setup allows to change the profiler mode to count all
IRQs/DMAs as \"sub-routines\". IRQs/DMAs which will then show u
everywhere in the tree where they have occurred. Also, IRQs/DMAs clock
cycles are then counted as normal sub-routine time to the interrupted
\"parent\" procedures.
Note: DMAs that are directly started by the CPU (by start immediately
timing) are always shown as local \"sub-routines\".
