# ARM CPU Versions


**Version Numbers**
ARM CPUs are distributed by name ARM#, and are described as ARMv# in
specifications, whereas \"#\" is NOT the same than \"v#\", for example
ARM7TDMI is ARMv4TM. That is so confusing, that ARM didn\'t even attemp
to clarify the relationship between the various \"#\" and \"v#\
values.

**Version Variants**
Suffixes like \"M\" (long multiply), \"T\" (Thumb support), \"E\
(Enhanced DSP) indicate presence of special features, additionally to
the standard instruction set of a given version, or, when preceded by an
\"x\", indicate the absence of that features.

**ARMv1 aka ARM1**
Some sort of a beta version, according to ARM never been used in any
commercial products.

**ARMv2 and up**
MUL,MLA
CDP,LDC,MCR,MRC,STC
SWP/SWPB (ARMv2a and up only)
Two new FIQ registers

**ARMv3 and up**
MRS,MSR opcodes (instead CMP/CMN/TST/TEQ{P} opcodes)
CPSR,SPSR registers (instead PSR bits in R15)
Removed never condition, cond=NV no longer valid
32bit addressing (instead 26bit addressing in older versions)
26bit addressing backwards comptibility mode (except v3G)
Abt and Und modes (instead handling aborts/undefined in Svc mode)
SMLAL,SMULL,UMLAL,UMULL (optionally, INCLUDED in v3M, EXCLUDED in
v4xM/v5xM)

**ARMv4 aka ARM7 and up**
LDRH,LDRSB,LDRSH,STRH
Sys mode (privileged user mode)
BX (only ARMv4T, and any ARMv5 or ARMv5T and up)
THUMB code (only T variants, ie. ARMv4T, ARMv5T)

**ARMv5 aka ARM9 and up**
BKPT,BLX,CLZ (BKPT,BLX also in THUMB mode)
LDM/LDR/POP PC with mode switch (POP PC also in THUMB mode)
CDP2,LDC2,MCR2,MRC2,STC2 (new coprocessor opcodes)
C-flag unchanged by MUL (instead undefined flag value)
changed instruction cycle timings / interlock ??? or not ???
QADD,QDADD,QDSUB,QSUB opcodes, CPSR.Q flag (v5TE and V5TExP only)
SMLAxy,SMLALxy,SMLAWy,SMULxy,SMULWy (v5TE and V5TExP only)
LDRD,STRD,PLD,MCRR,MRRC (v5TE only, not v5, not v5TExP)
BXJ (jump to Jazelle bytecode) (v5TEJ only)

**ARMv6 aka ARM11 and up (see ARM DDI 0100I)**
Supports all ARMv5TEJ features (=including Jazelle?).
The following ARM instructions are added:
- CPS, SRS and RFE instructions for improved exception handling
- REV, REV16 and REVSH byte reversal instructions
- SETEND for a revised endian (memory) model
- LDREX and STREX exclusive access instructions
- SXTB, SXTH, UXTB, UXTH byte/halfword extend instructions
- A set of Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) media instructions
- Additional forms of multiply with accumulation into a 64-bit result
The following Thumb instructions are added:
- CPS, CPY (a form of MOV), REV, REV16, REVSH, SETEND, SXTB, SXTH, UXTB,
UXTH
SWP/SWPB has been deprecated in ARMv6, made optional in ARMv7 (with the
possibility of disabling it if still available), and removed in ARMv8.

**ARMv6K aka \"ARM11 MPCore\" (see ARM DDI 0360F) (used in 3DS)**
Unknown how this is abbreviated (ARMv6-M would be something else:
Cortex-M).
The MPCore processor provides support for extensions to ARMv6 that
include:
- LDREX/STREX{B\|H\|D} for 8bit/16bit/64bit and CLREX
- HINT (TrueNOP, YIELD, WFI, WFE, SEV)
- Architectural remap registers.
- Revised use of TEX remap bits. The ARMv6 MMU page table descriptors
use a large number of bits to describe all of the options for inner and
outer cachability. In reality, no application requires all of these
options simultaneously. Therefore it is possible to use the TEX remap
mechanism to configure the MP11 CPUs to support only a small number of
options. This implies a level of indirection in the page table
mappings.
The TEX CB encoding table provides two OS managed page table bits. For
binary compatibility with existing ARMv6 ports of OSs, this gives a
separate mode of operation of the MMU. This is called the TEX Remap
- configuration and is controlled by bit \[28\] TR in CP15 Register 1.
- - Revised use of AP bits. In the MP11 CPUs the APX and AP\[1:0\
- encoding b111 is Privileged or User mode read-only access. AP\[0\
- indicates an abort type, Access Bit fault, when CP15 c1\[29\] is 1.
For more information see the ARM Architecture Reference Manual.

**ARMv6T2 aka THUMB-2**
This doesn\'t seem to be supported in 3DS. THUMB-2 adds more 2x16bi
opcodes in THUMB mode, ie. THUMB code can contain classic 16bit opcodes,
mixed with new 2x16bit opcodes. As far as I understand, the old 2x16bit
\"BL\" and \"BLX\" do no longer exists, or are replaced by differentl
encode THUMB-2 opcodes?

**ARMv6Z**
ARMv6K with Security Extensions. Aka TrustZone, see Processor Feature
Register 1.

**A Milestone in Computer History**
Original ARMv2 has been used in the relative rare and expensive
Archimedes deluxe home computers in the late eighties, the Archimedes
has caught a lot of attention, particularly for being the first home
computer that used a BIOS being programmed in BASIC language - which has
been a absolutely revolutionary decadency at that time.
Inspired, programmers all over the world have successfully developed
even slower and much more inefficient programming languages, which are
nowadays consequently used by nearly all ARM programmers, and by most
non-ARM programmers as well.
