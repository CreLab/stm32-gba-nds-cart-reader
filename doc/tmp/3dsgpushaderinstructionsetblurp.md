# 3DS GPU Shader Instruction Set - Blurp


**Overview**
A compiled shader binary is comprised of two parts: the main instruction
sequence and the operand descriptor table. These are both sent to the
GPU around the same time but using separate GPU Commands. Instructions
(such as format 1 instruction) may reference operand descriptors. When
such is the case, the operand descriptor ID is the offset, in words, of
the descriptor within the table. Both instructions and descriptors are
coded in little endian. Basic implementations of the following
- specification can be found at \[1\] and \[2\]. The instruction set seem
- to have been heavily inspired by Microsoft\'s vs_3_0 \[3\] and th
- Direct3D shader code \[4\]. Please note that this page is being writte
as the instruction set is reverse engineered; as such it may very well
contain mistakes.

Debug information found in the code.bin of \"Ironfall: Invasion\
suggests that there may not be more than 512 instructions and 128
operand descriptors in a shader.

**Instructions**
Unless noted otherwise, SRC1 and SRC2 refer to their respectively
- indexed float\[4\] registers (after swizzling). Similarly, DST refers t
its indexed register modulo destination component masking, i.e. an
expression like DST=SRC1 might actually just set DST.y to SRC1.y.

The component selector (the 8bit fragments with 4x2bits) enables
swizzling. For example, component selector 0x1B is equivalent to .xyzw,
while 0x55 is equivalent to .yyyy.

Depending on the current shader opcode, source components are disabled
implicitly by setting (\*to ZERO\*) the destination component mask. Fo
example, ADD o0.xy, r0.xyzw, r1.xyzw will not make use of r0\'s or r1\'
z/w components, while DP4 o0.xy, r0.xyzw, r1.xyzw will use all input
components regardless of the used destination component mask.

**Relative addressing**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       IDX  Address offset                                             |
|       00h  +0       ;-no offset                                       |
|       01h  +a0.x    ;\X or Y component of address register (see MOVA) 
|       02h  +a0.y    ;/                                                |
|       03h  +lp      ;-loop counter (see LOOP)                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

There are 3 address registers: a0.x, a0.y and aL (loop counter). For
format 1 instructions, when IDX != 0, the value of the corresponding
address register is added to SRC1\'s value. For example, if IDX = 2
a0.y = 3 and SRC1 = c8, then instead SRC1+a0.y = c11 will be used for
the instruction. It is only possible to use address registers with
vector uniform registers, attempting to use them with input attribute or
temporary registers results in the address register being ignored (i.e.
read as zero).

a0.x and a0.y are set manually through the MOVA instruction by rounding
a float value to integer precision. Hence, they may take negative
values.

aL can only be set indirectly by the LOOP instruction. It is still
accessible and valid after exiting a LOOP block, though.

**Comparison operator**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       CMPX/CMPY raw value   Operator name   Expression                |
|       00h                   EQ              src1 == src2              |
|       01h                   NE              src1 != src2              |
|       02h                   LT              src1 < src2               |
|       03h                   LE              src1 <= src2              |
|       04h                   GT              src1 > src2               |
|       05h                   GE              src1 >= src2              |
|                                                                       |
|     06h                   ??              seems to always return true |
|                                                                       |
|     07h                   ??              seems to always return true |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Conditions**
A number of format 2 instructions are executed conditionally. These
conditions are based on two boolean registers which can be set with CMP:
cmp.x and cmp.y.

Conditional instructions include 3 parameters: CONDOP, REFX and REFY.
REFX and REFY are reference values which are tested for equality against
cmp.x and cmp.y, respectively. CONDOP describes how the final truth
value is constructed from the results of the two tests. There are four
conditional expression formats:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|     CONDOP raw value    Expression                        Description |
|       00h                 cmp.x == REFX || cmp.y == REFY    OR        |
|       01h                 cmp.x == REFX && cmp.y == REFY    AND       |
|       02h                 cmp.x == REFX                     X         |
|       03h                 cmp.y == REFY                     Y         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Registers**
Input attribute registers (v0-v7?) store the per-vertex data given by
the CPU and hence are read-only.
Output attribute registers (o0-o6) hold the data to be passed to the
later GPU stages and are write-only. Each of the output attribute
register components is assigned a semantic by setting the corresponding
GPU_Internal_Registers.
Uniform registers hold user-specified data which is constant throughout
- all processed vertices. There are 96 float\[4\] uniform register
- (c0-c95), eight(???) boolean registers (b0-b7), and four int\[4\
registers (i0-i3).
Temporary registers (r0-r15) can be used for intermediate calculations
and can both be read and written.
Many shader instructions which take float arguments have only 5 bits
available for the second argument. They may hence only refer to input
attributes or temporary registers. In particular, it\'s not possible t
- pass two float\[4\] uniforms to these instructions.
It appears that writing twice to the same output register can cause
problems (eg. GPU hangs).

DST mapping:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       DST raw value  Register name   Description                      |
|                                                                       |
| 00h-06h?       o0-o6?          Output registers (aka output FIFO) (W) |
|       10h-1Fh        r0-r15          Temporary registers (R/W)        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


SRC1/SRC2/SRC3 mapping:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SRC raw value  Register name   Description                      |
|       00h-0                                                           |
| 7h?       v0-v7?          Input vertex/attribute (aka input FIFO) (R) |
|       10h-1Fh        r0-r15          Temporary registers              |
|       20h-7F                                                          |
| h        c0-c95          Vector uniform registers (only for 7bit SRC) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Control Flow**
Control flow is implemented using four independent stacks:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       4-deep CALL stack                                               |
|       8-deep IF stack                                                 |
|       4-deep LOOP stack                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All stacks are initially empty. After every instruction but before JMP
takes effect, the PC is incremented and a copy is sent to each stack.
Each stack is checked against its copy of the PC. If an entry is popped
from the stack, the copied PC is updated and used for the next check of
this stack, although the IF/LOOP stacks can each only pop one entry per
instruction, whereas the CALL stack is checked again until it doesn\'
match or the stack is empty. The updated PC copy with the highest
priority wins: LOOP (highest), IF, CALL, JMP, original PC (lowest).
