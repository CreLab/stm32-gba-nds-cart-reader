# 3DS GPU Shader Instruction Set - Blurp


### Overview
A compiled shader binary is comprised of two parts: the main instruction sequence and the operand descriptor table. These are both sent to the GPU around the same time but using separate GPU Commands. Instructions (such as format 1 instruction) may reference operand descriptors. When such is the case, the operand descriptor ID is the offset, in words, of the descriptor within the table. Both instructions and descriptors are coded in little endian. Basic implementations of the following specification can be found at \[1\] and \[2\]. The instruction set seems to have been heavily inspired by Microsoft\'s vs_3_0 \[3\] and the Direct3D shader code \[4\]. Please note that this page is being written as the instruction set is reverse engineered; as such it may very well contain mistakes.

Debug information found in the code.bin of \"Ironfall: Invasion\" suggests that there may not be more than 512 instructions and 128 operand descriptors in a shader.

### Nomenclature

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - opcode names with I appended to them are the same as their non-I version, |
|          except they use the inverted instruction format, giving 7 bits to SRC2  |
|          (and access to uniforms) and 5 bits to SRC1                             |
|      - opcode names with U appended to them are the same as their non-U version, |
|          except they are executed conditionally based on the value of a uniform  |
|          boolean.                                                                |
|      - opcode names with C appended to them are the same as their non-C version, |
|          except they are executed conditionally based on a logical expression    |
|          specified in the instruction.                                           |

### Instructions
Unless noted otherwise, SRC1 and SRC2 refer to their respectively indexed float\[4\] registers (after swizzling). Similarly, DST refers to its indexed register modulo destination component masking, i.e. an expression like DST=SRC1 might actually just set DST.y to SRC1.y.

The component selector (the 8bit fragments with 4x2bits) enables swizzling. For example, component selector 0x1B is equivalent to .xyzw, while 0x55 is equivalent to .yyyy.

Depending on the current shader opcode, source components are disabled implicitly by setting (\*to ZERO\*) the destination component mask. For example, ADD o0.xy, r0.xyzw, r1.xyzw will not make use of r0\'s or r1\'s z/w components, while DP4 o0.xy, r0.xyzw, r1.xyzw will use all input components regardless of the used destination component mask.

### Relative addressing

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       IDX  Address offset                                             |
|       00h  +0       ;-no offset                                       |
|       01h  +a0.x    ;\X or Y component of address register (see MOVA) 
|       02h  +a0.y    ;/                                                |
|       03h  +lp      ;-loop counter (see LOOP)                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

There are 3 address registers: a0.x, a0.y and aL (loop counter). For format 1 instructions, when IDX != 0, the value of the corresponding address register is added to SRC1\'s value. For example, if IDX = 2, a0.y = 3 and SRC1 = c8, then instead SRC1+a0.y = c11 will be used for the instruction. It is only possible to use address registers with vector uniform registers, attempting to use them with input attribute or temporary registers results in the address register being ignored (i.e. read as zero).

a0.x and a0.y are set manually through the MOVA instruction by rounding a float value to integer precision. Hence, they may take negative values.

aL can only be set indirectly by the LOOP instruction. It is still accessible and valid after exiting a LOOP block, though.

### Comparison operator

|       05h                   GE              src1 >= src2                |

|       07h                   ??              seems to always return true |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Conditions
A number of format 2 instructions are executed conditionally. These conditions are based on two boolean registers which can be set with CMP: cmp.x and cmp.y.

Conditional instructions include 3 parameters: CONDOP, REFX and REFY. REFX and REFY are reference values which are tested for equality against cmp.x and cmp.y, respectively. CONDOP describes how the final truth value is constructed from the results of the two tests. There are four conditional expression formats:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       CONDOP raw value    Expression                        Description |
|       00h                 cmp.x == REFX || cmp.y == REFY    OR          |
|       01h                 cmp.x == REFX && cmp.y == REFY    AND         |
|       02h                 cmp.x == REFX                     X           |
|       03h                 cmp.y == REFY                     Y           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Registers
Input attribute registers (v0-v7?) store the per-vertex data given by the CPU and hence are read-only.
Output attribute registers (o0-o6) hold the data to be passed to the later GPU stages and are write-only. Each of the output attribute register components is assigned a semantic by setting the corresponding GPU_Internal_Registers.
Uniform registers hold user-specified data which is constant throughout all processed vertices. There are 96 float\[4\] uniform registers (c0-c95), eight(???) boolean registers (b0-b7), and four int\[4\] registers (i0-i3).
Temporary registers (r0-r15) can be used for intermediate calculations and can both be read and written.
Many shader instructions which take float arguments have only 5 bits available for the second argument. They may hence only refer to input attributes or temporary registers. In particular, it\'s not possible to pass two float\[4\] uniforms to these instructions.
It appears that writing twice to the same output register can cause problems (eg. GPU hangs).

DST mapping:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       DST raw value  Register name   Description                            |
|       00h-06h?       o0-o6?          Output registers (aka output FIFO) (W) |
|       10h-1Fh        r0-r15          Temporary registers (R/W)              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


SRC1/SRC2/SRC3 mapping:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SRC raw value  Register name   Description                                  |
|       00h-07h?       v0-v7?          Input vertex/attribute (aka input FIFO) (R)  |
|       10h-1Fh        r0-r15          Temporary registers                          |
|       20h-7Fh        c0-c95          Vector uniform registers (only for 7bit SRC) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Control Flow
Control flow is implemented using four independent stacks:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       4-deep CALL stack                                               |
|       8-deep IF stack                                                 |
|       4-deep LOOP stack                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All stacks are initially empty. After every instruction but before JMP takes effect, the PC is incremented and a copy is sent to each stack. Each stack is checked against its copy of the PC. If an entry is popped from the stack, the copied PC is updated and used for the next check of this stack, although the IF/LOOP stacks can each only pop one entry per instruction, whereas the CALL stack is checked again until it doesn\'t match or the stack is empty. The updated PC copy with the highest priority wins: LOOP (highest), IF, CALL, JMP, original PC (lowest).
