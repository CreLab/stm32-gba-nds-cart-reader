# Parental Controls Reset


**Parental Controls Reset**
Click \"I Forgot\" when getting prompted to enter the PIN and Secre
Question, the console will then display an 8-digit Enquiry Number (or
10-digit with region/version RV/RVV in upper digits), the customer
service hotline uses that number (and the current month/day, MMDD) to
compute a 5-digit Master Key for resetting Parental Controls.

Newer(?) firmwares are using R=9 for japan (instead of R=0, maybe
because people did tend to omit leading zeroes when specifying the
Enquiry Number).
Alternately, an easier way to reset parental controls is to dump the PIN
from \"config\" (3DS) or TWLCFG (DSi).
