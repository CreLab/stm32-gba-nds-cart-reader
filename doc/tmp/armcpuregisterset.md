# ARM CPU Register Set


**Overview**
The following table shows the ARM7TDMI register set which is available
in each mode. There\'s a total of 37 registers (32bit each), 31 genera
registers (Rxx) and 6 status registers (xPSR).
Note that only some registers are \'banked\', for example, each mode ha
it\'s own R14 register: called R14, R14_fiq, R14_svc, etc. for each mod
respectively.
However, other registers are not banked, for example, each mode is using
the same R0 register, so writing to R0 will always affect the content of
R0 in other modes also.

**R0-R12 Registers (General Purpose Registers)**
These thirteen registers may be used for whatever general purposes.
Basically, each is having same functionality and performance, ie. there
is no \'fast accumulator\' for arithmetic operations, and no \'specia
pointer register\' for memory addressing.
However, in THUMB mode only R0-R7 (Lo registers) may be accessed freely,
while R8-R12 and up (Hi registers) can be accessed only by some
instructions.

**R13 Register (SP)**
This register is used as Stack Pointer (SP) in THUMB state. While in ARM
state the user may decided to use R13 and/or other register(s) as stack
pointer(s), or as general purpose register.
As shown in the table above, there\'s a separate R13 register in eac
mode, and (when used as SP) each exception handler may (and MUST!) use
its own stack.

**R14 Register (LR)**
This register is used as Link Register (LR). That is, when calling to a
sub-routine by a Branch with Link (BL) instruction, then the return
address (ie. old value of PC) is saved in this register.
Storing the return address in the LR register is obviously faster than
pushing it into memory, however, as there\'s only one LR register fo
each mode, the user must manually push its content before issuing
\'nested\' subroutines.
Same happens when an exception is called, PC is saved in LR of new
mode.
Note: In ARM mode, R14 may be used as general purpose register also,
provided that above usage as LR register isn\'t required.

**R15 Register (PC)**
R15 is always used as program counter (PC). Note that when reading R15,
this will usually return a value of PC+nn because of read-ahead
(pipelining), whereas \'nn\' depends on the instruction and on the CP
state (ARM or THUMB).

**CPSR and SPSR (Program Status Registers) (ARMv3 and up)**
The current condition codes (flags) and CPU control bits are stored in
the CPSR register. When an exception arises, the old CPSR is saved in
the SPSR of the respective exception-mode (much like PC is saved in
LR).
For details refer to chapter about CPU Flags.
