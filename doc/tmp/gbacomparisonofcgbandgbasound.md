# GBA Comparison of CGB and GBA Sound


The GBA sound controller is mostly the same than that of older monochrome gameboy and CGB. The following changes have been done:

### New Sound Channels
Two new sound channels have been added that may be used to replay 8bit digital sound. Sample rate and sample data must be supplied by using a Timer and a DMA channel.

### New Control Registers
The SOUNDCNT_H register controls the new DMA channels - as well as mixing with the four old channels. The SOUNDBIAS register controls the final sound output.

### Sound Channel 3 Changes
The length of the Wave RAM is doubled by dividing it into two banks of 32 digits each, either one or both banks may be replayed (one after each other), for details check NR30 Bit 5-6. Optionally, the sound may be output at 75% volume, for details check NR32 Bit 7.

### Changed Control Registers
NR50 is not supporting Vin signals (that\'s been an external sound input from cartridge).

### Changed I/O Addresses
The GBAs sound register are located at 04000060-040000AE instead of at FF10-FF3F as in CGB and monochrome gameboy. However, note that there have been new blank spaces inserted between some of the separate registers - therefore it is NOT possible to port CGB software to GBA just by changing the sound base address.

### Accessing I/O Registers
In some cases two of the old 8bit registers are packed into a 16bit register and may be accessed as such.
