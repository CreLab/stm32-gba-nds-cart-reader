# GBA Comparison of CGB and GBA Sound


The GBA sound controller is mostly the same than that of older
monochrome gameboy and CGB. The following changes have been done:

**New Sound Channels**
Two new sound channels have been added that may be used to replay 8bit
digital sound. Sample rate and sample data must be supplied by using a
Timer and a DMA channel.

**New Control Registers**
The SOUNDCNT_H register controls the new DMA channels - as well as
mixing with the four old channels. The SOUNDBIAS register controls the
final sound output.

**Sound Channel 3 Changes**
The length of the Wave RAM is doubled by dividing it into two banks of
32 digits each, either one or both banks may be replayed (one after each
other), for details check NR30 Bit 5-6. Optionally, the sound may be
output at 75% volume, for details check NR32 Bit 7.

**Changed Control Registers**
NR50 is not supporting Vin signals (that\'s been an external sound inpu
from cartridge).

**Changed I/O Addresses**
The GBAs sound register are located at 04000060-040000AE instead of at
FF10-FF3F as in CGB and monochrome gameboy. However, note that there
have been new blank spaces inserted between some of the separate
registers - therefore it is NOT possible to port CGB software to GBA
just by changing the sound base address.

**Accessing I/O Registers**
In some cases two of the old 8bit registers are packed into a 16bit
register and may be accessed as such.
