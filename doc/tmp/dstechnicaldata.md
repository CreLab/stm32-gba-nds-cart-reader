### NDS-Lite
Slightly smaller than the original NDS, coming in a more decently elegant case. The LCDs are much more colorful (and thus not backwards compatible with any older NDS or GBA games), and the LCDs support wider viewing angles. Slightly different power managment device (with selectable backlight brightness, new external power source flag, lost audio amplifier mute flag). Slightly different Wifi controller (different chip ID, different dirt effects when accessing invalid wifi ports and unused wifi memory regions, different behaviour on GAPDISP registers, RF/BB chips replaced by a single chip). Slightly different touch screen controller (with new unused input, and slightly different powerdown bits).

### Notice
NDS9 means the ARM9 processor and its memory and I/O ports in NDS mode
NDS7 means the ARM7 processor and its memory and I/O ports in NDS mode
GBA means the ARM7 processor and its memory and I/O ports in GBA mode

### The two Processors
Most game code is usually executed on the ARM9 processor (in fact, Nintendo reportedly doesn\'t allow developers use the ARM7 processor, except by predefined API functions, anyways, even with the most likely inefficient API code, most of the ARM7\'s 33MHz horsepower is left unused).
The ARM9\'s 66MHz \"horsepower\" is a different tale - it seems Nintendo thought that a 33MHz processor would be too \"slow\" for 3D games, and so they (tried to) badge an additional CPU to the original GBA hardware.
However, the real 66MHz can be used only with cache and tcm, all other memory and I/O accesses are delayed to the 33MHz bus clock, that\'d be still quite fast, but, there seems to be a hardware glitch that adds 3 waitcycles to all nonsequential accesses at the NDS9 side, which effectively drops its bus clock to about 8MHz, making it ways slower than the 33MHz NDS7 processor, it\'s even slower than the original 16MHz GBA processor.
Altogether, with the bugged 66MHz, and the unused 33MHz, Nintendo could have reached almost the same power when staying with the GBA\'s 16MHz processor :-)
Although, when properly using cache/tcm, then the 66MHz processor \<can\> be very fast, still, the NDS should have worked as well with a single processor, though using only an ARM9 might cause a lot of compatibility problems with GBA games, so there\'s at least one reason for keeping the ARM7 included.
