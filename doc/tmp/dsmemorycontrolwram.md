The ARM9 WRAM area is 3000000h-3FFFFFFh (16MB range).
The ARM7 WRAM area is 3000000h-37FFFFFh (8MB range).
The allocated 16K or 32K are mirrored everywhere in the above areas.
De-allocation (0K) is a special case: At the ARM9-side, the WRAM area is
then empty (containing undefined data). At the ARM7-side, the WRAM area
is then containing mirrors of the 64KB ARM7-WRAM (the memory at 3800000h
and up).
