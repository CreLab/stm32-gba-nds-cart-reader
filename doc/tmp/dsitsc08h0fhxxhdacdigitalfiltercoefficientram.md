- **TSC\[08h..0Bh:xxh\] - DAC Coefficient RAM, DAC Buffer A (252 
16bit)**
Coefficients are signed 16bit (-32,768..+32,767), each occupying 2 bytes
(MSB,LSB).
The MSB should always be written first, immediately followed by the LSB
(even if only the MSB or LSB portion of the coefficient changes, both
registers should be written in this sequence).

- **TSC\[0Ch..0Fh:xxh\] - DAC Coefficient RAM, DAC Buffer B (252 
16bit)**
This is essentially same as above Buffer A. But it\'s unclear if Buffe
B is having the same special Biquad/3DPGA/IIR/DRC functions (the
official datasheet doesn\'t mention them, but it does specify th
initial reset values same as for Buffer A, ie. with value 7FFFh for the
locations that correspond to \"N0\" coefficients, which is suggestin
that those special functions are present in Buffer B, too).
