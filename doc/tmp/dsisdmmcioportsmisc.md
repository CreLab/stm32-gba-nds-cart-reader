# DSi SD/MMC I/O Ports: Misc


**Toshiba Chips**
The DSi SDIO/MMC port addresses and status bits appear to be identical
to those on Toshiba SD/MMC/SDIO controller chips.
One small difference is that the DSi can set SD_IRQ_MASK.Bit27 (which
wasn\'t used on (older) Toshiba chips). The Toshiba chips seem t
include additional \"CNF\" configuration registers (which seem to b
missing on DSi).

The TC6380AF/TC6387XB/TC6391XB datasheets are more or less identical on
the SD/MMC/SDIO section, TC6387XB is probably the best reference because
it doesn\'t contain offtopic extras like SmartMedia, USB, LCD, etc. Th
datasheets contain I/O Maps with port addresses, but no description
tables for the bits in those ports (though some bits are mentioned here
and there in the text, scattered across many different pages, and other
bits are left completely undocumented).
