# 3DS I2C New3DS C-Stick and ZL/ZR-Buttons


**I2C Bus/Device 2:54h - C-Stick and ZL/ZR-Buttons**
This is a New3DS-only device (the Old3DS does have a similar add-on:
Circle Pad Pro, connected to the infrared expansion port).
Oberseve that the bootrom doesn\'t initialize I2C_BUS2_CNTEX/SC
(especially CNTEX is required to have \"Wait if SCL held low\" enabled
else the C-stick replies are garbage).
The chip triggers ARM11 IRQ 68h (aka GPIO_DATA3.bit0=0) when moving the
analog input or buttons. Reading the I2C data changes GPIO back to
bit0=1.
Maybe this is the HUGE 44pin HF374 chip on button board, but if it\'
merely used for ZL/ZR and C-stick, why is that chip so huge?

**I2C Read(Device+1,Byte0,Byte1,Byte2,Byte3,\...)**
Reading returns some kind of array, always starting with the status
value in byte0, there is no need to write an index value before
reading.
The array has useful info stored in first 4-7 bytes; and
internal/garbage when reading further bytes, up to including something
that looks like a CPU stack).

Caution: The chip hangs after some seconds when reading more than 1Ah
bytes; at that point all values get frozen (except, the \"stack\" a
DDh..EDh does keep changing).

**I2C Write(Device,Mode)**
Writing does set a mode value, eg. write(Device,Mode). There is no need
to write anything, the analog input and irq are automatically enabled on
power-up. Effects for different mode values are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       None      Default is Status=80h at power-up                     |
|       00h..51h  Set Status=80h                                        |
|       52h..F4h  Set Status=81h                                        |
|       F5h       Set Status=82h                                        |
|       F6h..F9h  Set Status=83h                                        |
|       FAh..FBh  Set Status=81h                                        |
|       FCh..FDh  Set Status=FFh                                        |
|       FEh       Set Status=80h with long 1 second I2C-clk-hold delay? |
|       FFh       Set Status=80h                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unknown what those mode/status values are meaning exactly. Maybe some
can change polling interval or enable/disable interrupts, or maybe even
do dangerous stuff like reflashing the firmware?
Some of the mode values disable the Analog bytes at index 02h/03h
(causing that bytes to become always 00h, or maybe actually divide them
by a large value, causing them to be always NEAR 00h?)
Trying to write more bytes (eg. write(Device,xx,yy) seems to apply the
last written byte as mode value.

**Operating System**
The 3DS OS does access the C-stick via IR:RST service (probably for
backwards compatibility with Circle Pad Pro, which was accessed via
infrared).
The OS can reportedly change the update period in range of 10..21ms (aka
0Ah..15h), maybe via whatever I2C write.
The OS does reportedly return analog values in range -9Ch..+9Ch, maybe
that are the I2C values scaled for Circle Pad Pro compatibility, or
maybe a sum of multiple I2C values?
