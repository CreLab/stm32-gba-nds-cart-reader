# GBA Cart Tilt Sensor


Yoshi\'s Universal Gravitation / Yoshi Topsy Turvy (X/Y-Axis)
Koro Koro Puzzle (probably same as Yoshi, X/Y-Axis, too) (?)

### Yoshi-Type (X/Y-Axis)
All of the registers are one byte wide, mapped into the top \"half\" of the SRAM memory range.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       E008000h (W) Write 55h to start sampling                                    |
|       E008100h (W) Write AAh to start sampling                                    |
|       E008200h (R) Lower 8 bits of X axis                                         |
|       E008300h (R) Upper 4 bits of X axis, and Bit7: ADC Status (0=Busy, 1=Ready) |
|       E008400h (R) Lower 8 bits of Y axis                                         |
|       E008500h (R) Upper 4 bits of Y axis                                         |

You must set SRAM wait control to 8 clocks to access it correctly.
You must also set the cartridge PHI terminal to 4 MHz to make it work.
Sampling routine (typically executed once a frame during VBlank):

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       wait until [E008300h].Bit7=1 or until timeout ;wait ready            |
|       x = ([E008300h] AND 0Fh)*100h + [E008200h]    ;get x                 |
|       y = ([E008500h] AND 0Fh)*100h + [E008400h]    ;get y                 |
|       [E008000h]=55h, [E008100h]=AAh                ;start next conversion |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Example values (may vary on different carts and on temperature, etc):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       X ranged between 0x2AF to 0x477, center at 0x392.    Huh?       |
|       Y ranged between 0x2C3 to 0x480, center at 0x3A0.    Huh?       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Thanks to Flubba for Yoshi-Type information.
Unknown if the Yoshi-Type sensors are sensing rotation, or orientation, or motion, or something else? In case of rotation, rotation around X-axis would result in motion in Y-direction, so not too sure whether X and Y have which meaning?
Most probably, the sensors are measuring (both) static acceleration (gravity), and dynamic acceleration (eg. shaking the device left/right).
The X/Y values are likely to be mirrored depending on using a back-loading cartridge slot (original GBA), or front-loading cartridge slot (newer GBA SP, and NDS, and NDS-Lite).
