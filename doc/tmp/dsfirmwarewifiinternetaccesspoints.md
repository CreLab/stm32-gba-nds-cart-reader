# DS Firmware Wifi Internet Access Points


- **Connection data 1 at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-400h (eg
01FA00h/03FA00h/07FA00h)**
- **Connection data 2 at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-300h (eg
01FB00h/03FB00h/07FB00h)**
- **Connection data 3 at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-200h (eg
01FC00h/03FC00h/07FC00h)**
These three 100h byte regions are used to memorize known internet access
points. The NDS firmware doesn\'t use these regions, but games tha
support internet are allowed to read (and configure/write) them. The DSi
firmware also supports configuring these entries.

- For connection 3: entries \[0EFh..0FDh\] - always zero-filled?
The location of the first data block is at the User Settings address
- minus 400h, ie. Firmware Header \[00020h\]\*8-400h.

- **Connection data 4 at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-A00h (eg. 01F400h) (DS
only)**
- **Connection data 5 at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-800h (eg. 01F600h) (DS
only)**
- **Connection data 6 at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-600h (eg. 01F800h) (DS
only)**
The DSi has three extra 200h-byte regions (for use DSi games, with the
new WPA/WPA2 encryption support, and with additional proxy support),
these extra regions are found under \"Advanced Setup\" in the DS
firmware\'s \"Internet\" configuration menu.

```

The location of the first data block (aka settings number 4) is at the
User Settings address minus A00h, ie. Firmware Header
- \[00020h\]\*8-A00h.
Observe that NDS consoles do have NDS Firmware bootcode/data in that
area, so those new regions can exist on DSi only (or on homebrew NDS
firmwares). Presence of the new regions is indicated in Firmware Header
- \[001FEh\], that byte is usually FFh=NDS or 20h=DSi, the DSi browse
does internally replace FFh by 10h, and does then check if byte\>=20
(ie. the new areas exist if the byte is 20h..FEh).
Note that the Proxy feature can be used to redirect internet access
(when using a custom proxy server, one could redirect commercial games
to homebrew servers; as done by the <http://pbsds.net/> project)
(actually the same should be possible with the DNS server entry,
possibly with less traffic).

**Note**
The location of the user settings & connection data varies (eg.
01Fxxxh=DSi, 03Fxxxh=NDS, 07Fxxxh=iQueDS).

**Nintendo Zone Beacons**
DSi games and DSi browser can reportedly also connect to Nintendo\'
public access points (those that are announced via Nintendo Zone
Beacons).

- **Hidden Connection data at WifiFlash\[00020h\]\*8-100h (eg. xxFD00h)**
This seems to hold an extra 100h-byte region (same as Connection data
1-3), some (or all) NDS/DSi games seem to be capable of using it
(although it isn\'t shown in config menues). One theory is that it migh
be used for the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector?
