# DSi SD/MMC DSiware Files on Internal eMMC Storage


DSiware games (downloaded from DSi Shop), and pre-installed System Tools
are consisting of following files:

**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\content\\000000vv.app ;executabl
(decrypted)**
Contains the executable, with same header as used in Cartridge ROM
images, and usually with a NitroROM File System (ie. a second virtual
filesystem inside of the FAT16 filesystem).
- [DSi Cartridge Header](./dsicartridgeheader.md)
- [DS Cartridge NitroROM and NitroARC FileSystems](./dscartridgenitroromandnitroarcfilesystems.md)
Note: There are also three non-executable \".app\" files withou
cartridge headers (Wifi Firmware, Version Data, and DS Cart Whitelist).

**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\data\\public.sav ;size a
- carthdr\[238h\]**
**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\data\\private.sav ;size a
- carthdr\[23Ch\]**
These files can contain whatever save data. The .sav files are usually
containing a FAT12 with its own VBR, FAT, and Directories (so they use
some virtual FAT12 inside of the real FAT16).
When exporting a game to SD Card (via System Settings, Data Managment),
then public.sav (eg. used by Flipnote) will be included in the exported
image, whilst private.sav (eg. used by DSi Browser) won\'t be included.

**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\data\\ec.cfg ;dsi shop only**
Whatever extra file, encrypted, 134h bytes, used by DSi Shop only.

**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\data\\banner.sav ;i
- carthdr\[1BFh\].bit2=1**
Custom icon, used by some games to indicate the game progress. Format is
similar as Icon/Title, but containing only animated icon data (without
title). For details, see:
- [DS Cartridge Icon/Title](./dscartridgeicontitle.md)

**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\content\\title.tmd ;tmd (52
bytes)**
**FAT16:\\ticket\\000300tt\\4ggggggg.tik (encrypted) ;ticket (70
bytes)**
**FAT16:\\ticket\\000300tt\\00000000.tik (encrypted) ;multi-tik? (N\*70
bytes?)**
These files do contain title metadata (.tmd) and tickets (.tik).
- [DSi SD/MMC DSiware Tickets and Titlemetadata](./dsisdmmcdsiwareticketsandtitlemetadata.md)
The .tik files are encrypted with ES Block Encryption (using same key
X/Y as for dev.kp):

```

- |       KEY_X[00h..03h] = 4E00004Ah                           ;\        
|       KE                                                              |
- | Y_X[04h..07h] = 4A00004Eh                           ; same as for Tad |
- |       KEY_X[08h..0Bh] = Port[4004D00h+4] xor C80C4B72h      ;         |
- |       KEY_X[0Ch..0Fh] = Port[4004D00h+0]                    ;/        |

```

Caution: There are some ways to modify .tmd files, but that can cause
the whole title to be deleted when starting one of the following three
tools:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
| Data Management (in System Settings), DSi Shop, and 3DS transfer tool |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

These tools will delete the titles \"content\" folder (with .app an
.tmd files) and the \"data\" folder (with .sav files). As a workaroung
Set read-only attribute for .tmd and .app files (the deletion aborts
once when hitting a read-only file; with the files being processed as
ordered in the directory).
Note: Tickets are kept stored in eMMC even after deleting titles
(that\'s allowing to redownload the titles for free; at least that\'
been the case when the DSi shop was still online).

Below \"wrap.bin\" and \"menusave.dat\" files are containing lists o
installed titles, however, it isn\'t neccessary to edit those files whe
manually installing .tmd/.app/.tik files.

**FAT16:\\shared2\\launcher\\wrap.bin (16Kbytes)**
Contains a list of installed DSiware Title IDs (in no specific order).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       0000h 14h   SHA1 on entries [014h..03Fh]                        |
- |       0014h 14h   SHA1 on entries [040h..177h]                        |

- |  138h  Space for 39 Title IDs (as at cart[230h]) (8x00h=unused entry) |
|                                                                       |
|    0178h 3E88h Unknown (looks like random/garbage, or encrypted junk) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**FAT16:\\title\\00030017\\484e41gg\\data\\private.sav:\\menusave.da
(System Menu)**
This private.sav file contains a 4000h-byte FAT12 image. The FAT12
contains only one file: menusave.dat (154h bytes), containing a list of
Title IDs (and their sort-order how they are arranged in System Menu;
users can drag the icons to rearrange their ordering):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000h 4     ID ("TSSV")                                         |
|       0004h 4     Zerofilled (used somehow, can be nonzero?)          |
|       0008h 2                                                         |
- |      CRC16 on [000h..0153h], initial value 5356h, assume [008h]=0000h |
|       000Ah 6     Zerofilled                                          |
|       0010h                                                           |
|  39x8  Title IDs (gg,gg,gg,gg,tt,00,03,00) (0=NDS CartSlot or Unused) |
|       0148h 8     Zerofilled                                          |
|       0150h 4     Index of NDS CartSlot Entry (0..39)                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The current selection isn\'t stored in this file (instead, the Title I
of the most recently selected title is stored in the TWLCFGn.dat
files).
Note that the \"Nintendo Zone\" utility isn\'t included in this lis
(even though it\'s present in title & ticket folders, and listed i
wrap.bin).
The System Menu works even if data\\private.sav doesn\'t exist (however
the sort-order is stored only if data\\private.sav does exist).
