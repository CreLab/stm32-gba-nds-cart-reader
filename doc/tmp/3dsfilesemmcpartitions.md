# 3DS Files - eMMC Partitions


The 3DS can have up to eight primary NCSD partitions, some of these partitions point to secondary MBR partition tables, each of those MBRs could have up to four child partitions (with FAT filesystems).

### Encryption
The NAND file system is encrypted using AES-CTR. The keyslot used for each partition is determined by the NCSD partition FS type and encryption type.

NAND sectors which were never written to contain plaintext 00h or FFh bytes.

None of the NAND partitions are normally accessible from the ARM11, except for twlp. CTR/TWL NAND FS can only be accessed when the exheader access control descriptor for those are enabled. Normally the CTR/TWL NAND descriptors are never enabled for retail ARM11 CXI processes. The ARM11 can only access \"nand:/rw/\" mounted as the nandrw archive, and \"nand:/ro/\" mounted as the nandro archive below.

### eMMC 4000h (on some consoles) (empty 00h-filled on others)
On some 3DS systems (such as 3DS XL), there\'s a plaintext FAT16 boot record located at NAND offset 0x4000. This block does not exist for launch-day 3DS systems. This is the only plaintext block for this \"partition\".
That is, a 200h-byte VBR sector with string FAT16 (the actual FAT, Root, and Data sectors don\'t exist\... and the Data clusters would probably overlap other partitions).

### eMMC 12C00h (aka Sector 96h) (New3DS only) (empty FFh-filled on Old3DS)

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 10h   Used for generating Key X values for keyslot 15h and 18h           |
|       010h 10h   Used for generating Key X values for keyslot 16h and 19h-1Fh ;v9.6 |
|       020h 1E0h  Further constants (unused)                                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This 200h-byte sector contains New3DS keys, this entire sector is encrypted via AES-ECB with a console-unique keyX+keyY. The keyX+keyY for this is generated by the New3DS arm9bin-loader. Once the arm9bin-loader finishes decrypting this data, the keyX+keyY in the keyslot are then cleared, then the memory used for generating the keydata is disabled (after it finishes using it for TWL key init).
The decrypted sector is same on all New3DS consoles (except, retail-vs-debug are different):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Decrypted 200h-bytes on Retail: 07h,29h,44h,38h, ..., 13h,63h,CFh,8Fh |
|       Decrypted 200h-bytes on Dev:    Unknown...                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### 3DS CTR partition
The structure of nand/title appears to be exactly the same as SD, except savegames are stored under the nand/data/\<ID0\>/sysdata directory instead. The sub-directory name under nand/data is the SHA256 hash over the movable.sed keyY. This nand/data/\<ID0\> directory is the NAND equivalent of the \"sdmc/Nintendo 3DS/\<ID0\>/\<ID1\>\" directory, however the data contained here is stored in cleartext. The movable.sed keyY is only used for AES MACs for nand/data/\<ID0\>. The nand/data/\<ID0\>/extdata directory contains the shared extdata, and is structured exactly the same way as SD extdata.

### DSi TWL partition
The structure of these TWL partitions is mostly the same as DSi, except tickets are stored in the CTR FAT FS. The twlp partition is exactly the same as DSi. The structure of twln/title is exactly the same as CTR NAND/SD, except the .cmd file is a cleartext file (this is likely a dummy file). The data directory under system titles\' /title directory does not exist, this likely only exists for DSiWare. The directory names titleID-High used under twln/title is from DSi.

```

Unknown purpose, might be some debug log, or undo-info for handling incomplete FAT writes to the 3DS partition? If so, unknown if it\'s important to update/delete the journal file after manually changing FAT contents (to prevent the OS from corrupting/undoing the manual changes).
Unknown if there is a list of sector numbers for the 200h-byte sectors (maybe that list exists, but gets zerofilled after completion?), unknown why there are only short filenames (normally there should be also long/lowercase names).
