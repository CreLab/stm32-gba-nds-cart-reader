# ARM CPU Flags & Condition Field (cond)


### ARM Condition Field {cond}
The opcode {cond} suffixes can be used for conditionally executed code based on the C,N,Z,V flags in CPSR register. For example: BEQ = Branch if Equal, MOVMI = Move if Signed.
In ARM mode, {cond} can be used with all opcodes (except for a few newer ARMv5 instructions: BKPT, PLD, CDP2, LDC2, MCR2, MRC2, STC2, and BLX_imm are nonconditional; however BLX_reg can be conditional).
In THUMB mode, {cond} can be used only for branch opcodes.

### Bit 31-28: Condition Code Flags (N,Z,C,V)
These bits reflect results of logical or arithmetic instructions. In ARM mode, it is often optionally whether an instruction should modify flags or not, for example, it is possible to execute a SUB instruction that does NOT modify the condition flags.
In ARM state, all instructions can be executed conditionally depending on the settings of the flags, such like MOVEQ (Move if Z=1). While In THUMB state, only Branch instructions (jumps) can be made conditionally.

### Bit 27: Sticky Overflow Flag (Q) - ARMv5TE and ARMv5TExP and up only
Used by QADD, QSUB, QDADD, QDSUB, SMLAxy, and SMLAWy only. These opcodes set the Q-flag in case of overflows, but leave it unchanged otherwise. The Q-flag can be tested/reset by MSR/MRS opcodes only.

### Bit 27-8: Reserved Bits (except Bit 27 on ARMv5TE and up, see above)
These bits are reserved for possible future implementations. For best forwards compatibility, the user should never change the state of these bits, and should not expect these bits to be set to a specific value.

### Bit 7-0: Control Bits (I,F,T,M4-M0)
These bits may change when an exception occurs. In privileged modes (non-user modes) they may be also changed manually.
The interrupt bits I and F are used to disable IRQ and FIQ interrupts respectively (a setting of \"1\" means disabled).
The T Bit signalizes the current state of the CPU (0=ARM, 1=THUMB), this bit should never be changed manually - instead, changing between ARM and THUMB state must be done by BX instructions.
The Mode Bits M4-M0 contain the current operating mode.

Writing any other values into the Mode bits is not allowed.

### Saved Program Status Registers (SPSR\_\<mode\>)
Additionally to above CPSR, five Saved Program Status Registers exist:
SPSR_fiq, SPSR_svc, SPSR_abt, SPSR_irq, SPSR_und
Whenever the CPU enters an exception, the current status register (CPSR) is copied to the respective SPSR\_\<mode\> register. Note that there is only one SPSR for each mode, so nested exceptions inside of the same mode are allowed only if the exception handler saves the content of SPSR in memory.
For example, for an IRQ exception: IRQ-mode is entered, and CPSR is copied to SPSR_irq. If the interrupt handler wants to enable nested IRQs, then it must first push SPSR_irq before doing so.
