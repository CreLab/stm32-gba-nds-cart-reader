# SIO JOY BUS Mode


This communication mode uses Nintendo\'s standardized JOY Bus protocol
When using this communication mode, the GBA is always operated as
SLAVE!

The JOY BUS mode is intended for communicating with Nintendo Gamecube
(DOL) consoles, where the GBA would somehow act as peripheral for the
Gamecube (unknown if/which Gamecube games are supporting that feature).

In this mode, SI and SO pins are data lines (apparently synchronized by
Start/Stop bits?), SC and SD are set to low (including during active
transfer?), the transfer rate is unknown?

Bit 0-2 are working much like the bits in the IF register: Write a \"1\
bit to reset (acknowledge) the respective bit.
UNCLEAR: Interrupts can be requested for Send/Receive commands also?

Bit 1 is automatically set when writing to local JOY_TRANS.
Bit 3 is automatically reset when reading from local JOY_RECV.

Below are the four possible commands which can be received by the GBA.
Note that the GBA (slave) cannot send any commands itself, all it can do
is to read incoming data, and to provide \'reply\' data which may (o
may not) be read out by the master unit.

**Command FFh - Device Reset**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Receive FFh (Command)                                           |

|       Send    04h (GBA Type number MSB)                               |
|       Send    XXh (lower 8bits of JOYSTAT register)                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Command 00h - Type/Status Data Request**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|       Send    XXh (lower 8bits of JOYSTAT register)                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
