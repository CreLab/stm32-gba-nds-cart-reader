# DS 3D Polygon Light Parameters


The lighting operation is performed by executing the Normal command
(which sets the VertexColor based on the Light/Material parameters) (to
the rest of the hardware it doesn\'t matter if the VertexColor was se
by Color command or by Normal command). Light is calculated only for the
Front side of the polygon (assuming that the Normal is matched to that
side), so the Back side will be (incorrectly) using the same color.

**40004C8h - Cmd 32h - LIGHT_VECTOR - Set Light\'s Directional Vecto
(W)**
Sets direction of the specified light (ie. the light selected in
Bit30-31).

```

Upon executing this command, the incoming vector is multiplied by the
current Directional Matrix, the result is then applied as LightVector.
This allows to rotate the light direction. However, normally, to keep
the light unrotated, be sure to use LoadIdentity (in MtxMode=2) before
setting the LightVector.

**40004CCh - Cmd 33h - LIGHT_COLOR - Set Light Color (W)**
Sets the color of the specified light (ie. the light selected in
Bit30-31).

```

With Bit15 set, the lower 15bits are applied as VertexColor (exactly as
when when executing the Color command), the purpose is to use it as
default color (eg. when outcommenting the Normal command), normally,
when using lighting, the color setting gets overwritten (as soon as
executing the Normal command).

Caution: Specular Reflection WON\'T WORK when the ProjectionMatrix i
rotated.

**40004D0h - Cmd 34h - SHININESS - Specular Reflection Shininess Table
(W)**
Write 32 parameter words (each 32bit word containing four 8bit entries),
entries 0..3 in the first word, through entries 124..127 in the last
word:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   S                                                         |

```

If the table is disabled (by MaterialColor1.Bit15), then reflection will
act as if the table would be filled with linear increasing numbers.

**4000484h - Cmd 21h - NORMAL - Set Normal Vector (W)**
In short, this command does calculate the VertexColor, based on the
various light-parameters.
In detail, upon executing this command, the incoming vector is
multiplied by the current Directional Matrix, the result is then applied
as NormalVector (giving it the same rotation as used for the following
polygon vertices).

```

```

Defines the Polygon\'s Normal. And, does then update the Vertex Color
by recursing the View Direction, the NormalVector, the LightVector(s),
and Light/Material Colors. The execution time of the Normal command
varies depending on the number of enabled light(s).

**Additional Light Registers**
Additionally to above registers, light(s) must be enabled in PolygonAttr
(mind that changes to PolygonAttr aren\'t applied until next Begi
command). And, the Directional Matrix must be set up correctly (in
MtxMode=2) for the LightVector and NormalVector commands.

**Normal Vector**
The Normal vector must point \"away from the polygon surface\" (eg. fo
the floor, the Normal should point upwards). That direction is implied
by the polygon vertices, however, the hardware cannot automatically
calculate it, so it must be set manually with the Normal command (prior
to the VTX-commands).
When using lighting, the Normal command must be re-executed after
switching Lighting on/off, or after changing light/material parameters.
And, of course, also before defining polygons with different
orientation. Polygons with same orientation (eg. horizontal polygon
surfaces) and same material color can use the same Normal. Changing the
Normal per polygon gives differently colored polygons with flat
surfaces, changing the Normal per vertex gives the illusion of curved
surfaces.

**Light Vector**
Each light consists of parallel beams; similar to sunlight, which
appears to us (due to the great distance) to consist of parallel beams,
all emmitted into the same direction; towards Earth.
In reality, light is emitted into ALL directions, originated from the
light source (eg. a candle), the hardware doesn\'t support that type o
non-parallel light. However, the light vectors can be changed per
polygon, so a polygon that is located north of the light source may use
different light direction than a polygon that is east of the light
source.
And, of course, Light 0..3 may (and should) have different directions.

**Normalized Vectors**
The Normal Vector and the Light Vectors should be normalized (ie. their
length should be 1.0) (in practice: something like 0.99, since the
registers have only fractional parts) (a length of 1.0 can cause
overflows).

**Lighting Limitations**
The functionality of the light feature is limited to reflecting light to
the camera (light is not reflected to other polygons, nor does it cast
shadows on other polygons). However, independently of the lighting
feature, the DS hardware does allow to create shadows, see:
- [DS 3D Shadow Polygons](./ds3dshadowpolygons.md)

```


**Internal Operation on Light_Vector Command (for Light i)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       LightVector[i] = (LightVector*DirectionalMatrix)                |
- |       HalfVector[i] = (LightVector[i]+LineOfSightVector)/2            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**LineOfSightVector (how it SHOULD work)**
Ideally, the LineOfSightVector should point from the camera to the
vertic(es), however, the vertic(es) are still unknown at time of normal
command, so it is just pointing from the camera to the screen, ie.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       LineOfSightVector = (0,0,-1.0)                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Moreover, the LineOfSightVector should be multiplied by the Projection
Matrix (so the vector would get rotated accordingly when the camera gets
rotated), and, after multiplication by a scaled matrix, it\'d b
required to normalize the resulting vector.

**LineOfSightVector (how it DOES actually work)**
However, the NDS cannot normalize vectors by hardware, and therefore, it
does completely leave out the LineOfSightVector\*ProjectionMatri
multiplication. So, the LineOfSightVector is always (0,0,-1.0), no
matter of any camera rotation. That means,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Sp                                                              |
| ecular Reflection WON'T WORK when the ProjectionMatrix is rotated (!) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

So, if you want to rotate the \"camera\" (in MTX_MODE=0), then you mus
instead rotate the \"world\" in the opposite direction (in MTX_MODE=2).
That problem applies only to Specular Reflection, ie. only if Lighting
is used, and only if the Specular Material Color is nonzero.

**Maths Notes**
Note on Vector\*Vector multiplication: Processed a
LineVector\*RowVector, so the result is a number (aka scalar) (aka 
matrix with only 1x1 elements), multiplying two (normalized) vectors
results in: \"cos(angle)=vec1\*vec2\", ie. the cosine of the angl
between the two vectors.
The various Normal/Light/Half/Sight vectors are only 3-dimensional
(x,y,z), ie. only the upper-left 3x3 matrix elements are used on
multiplications with the 4x4 DirectionalMatrix.
