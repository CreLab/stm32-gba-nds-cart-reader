Above \'trap\' is meant to be the execution time for exceptions. An
\'{cond} false\' is meant to be the execution time for conditiona
instructions which haven\'t been actually executed because the conditio
has been false.

The separate meaning of the N,S,I,C cycles is:

**N - Non-sequential cycle**
Requests a transfer to/from an address which is NOT related to the
address used in the previous cycle. (Called 1st Access in GBA
language).
The execution time for 1N is 1 clock cycle (plus non-sequential access
waitstates).

**S - Sequential cycle**
Requests a transfer to/from an address which is located directly after
the address used in the previous cycle. Ie. for 16bit or 32bit accesses
at incrementing addresses, the first access is Non-sequential, the
following accesses are sequential. (Called 2nd Access in GBA language).
The execution time for 1S is 1 clock cycle (plus sequential access
waitstates).

**I - Internal Cycle**
CPU is just too busy, not even requesting a memory transfer for now.
The execution time for 1I is 1 clock cycle (without any waitstates).

**C - Coprocessor Cycle**
The CPU uses the data bus to communicate with the coprocessor (if any),
but no memory transfers are requested.

**Memory Waitstates**
Ideally, memory may be accessed free of waitstates (1N and 1S are then
equal to 1 clock cycle each). However, a memory system may generate
waitstates for several reasons: The memory may be just too slow. Memory
is currently accessed by DMA, eg. sound, video, memory transfers, etc.
Or when data is squeezed through a 16bit data bus (in that special case,
32bit access may have more waitstates than 8bit and 16bit accesses).
Also, the memory system may separate between S and N cycles (if so, S
cycles would be typically faster than N cycles).

**Memory Waitstates for Different Memory Areas**
Different memory areas (eg. ROM and RAM) may have different waitstates.
When executing code in one area which accesses data in another area,
then the S+N cycles must be split into code and data accesses: 1N is
used for data access, plus (n-1)S for LDM/STM, the remaining S+N are
code access. If an instruction jumps to a different memory area, then
all code cycles for that opcode are having waitstate characteristics of
the NEW memory area (except Thumb BL which still executes 1S in OLD
area).
