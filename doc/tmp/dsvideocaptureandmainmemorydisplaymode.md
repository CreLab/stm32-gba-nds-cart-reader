+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Notes:
VRAM Read Block (VRAM A..D) is selected in DISPCNT Bits 18-19.
VRAM Read Block can be (or must be ?) allocated to LCDC (MST=0).
VRAM Read Offset is ignored (zero) in VRAM Display Mode
(DISPCNT.16-17).
VRAM Read/Write Offsets wrap to 00000h when exceeding 1FFFFh (max
128K).
Capture Sizes less than 256x192 capture the upper-left portion of the
screen.
Blending factors EVA and EVB are used only if \"Source A+B blended\
selected.
After setting the Capture Enable bit, capture starts at next line 0, and
the capture enable/busy bit is then automatically cleared (in line 192,
regardless of the capture size).

Capture data is 15bit color depth (even when capturing 18bit
3D-images).
Capture A: Dest_Intensity = SrcA_Intensitity ; Dest_Alpha=SrcA_Alpha.
Capture B: Dest_Intensity = SrcB_Intensitity ; Dest_Alpha=SrcB_Alpha.
Capture A+B (blending):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Dest_Intensity = (  (SrcA_Intensitity * SrcA_Alpha * EVA)        |
|                        + (SrcB_Intensitity * SrcB_Alpha * EVB) ) / 16 |
|      Dest_Alpha = (SrcA_Alpha AND (EVA>0)) OR (SrcB_Alpha AND EVB>0)) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


Capture provides a couple of interesting effects.
For example, 3D Engine output can be captured via source A (to
LCDC-allocated VRAM), in the next frame, either Graphics Engine A or B
can display the captured 3D image in VRAM image as BG2, BG3, or OBJ
(from BG/OBJ-allocated VRAM); this method requires to switch between
LCDC- and BG/OBJ-allocation.
Another example would be to capture Engine A output, the captured image
can be displayed (via VRAM Display mode) in the following frames,
simultaneously the new Engine A output can be captured, blended with the
old captured image; in that mode moved objects will leave traces on the
screen; this method works with a single LCDC-allocated VRAM block.

**4000068h - NDS9 - DISP_MMEM_FIFO - 32bit - Main Memory Display FIFO
(R?/W)**
Intended to send 256x192 pixel 32K color bitmaps by DMA directly

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      -                                                                |
| to Screen A             (set DISPCNT to Main Memory Display mode), or |
|                                                                       |
|     - to Display Capture unit (set DISPCAPCNT to Main Memory Source). |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The FIFO can receive 4 words (8 pixels) at a time, each pixel is a 15bit
RGB value (the upper bit, bit15, is unused).
Set DMA to Main Memory mode, 32bit transfer width, word count set to 4,
destination address to DISP_MMEM_FIFO, source address must be in Main
Memory.
Transfer starts at next frame.
Main Memory Display/Capture is supported for Display Engine A only.
