# DS Power Control


The DS contains several Power Managment functions, some accessed via I/O
ports (described below), and some accessed via SPI bus:

Use SwapBuffers command once after enabling Rendering/Geometry Engine.
Improper use of Bit0 may damage the hardware?
When disabled, corresponding Ports become Read-only, corresponding
(palette-) memory becomes read-only-zero-filled.

Note: Bit0 disables the internal Speaker only, headphones are not
disabled.
Bit1 disables Port 4000206h, and Ports 4800000h-480FFFFh.

This register is initialized by firmware on power-up (set to 0030h,
other software shouldn\'t change that setting). The timings are pe
16bit halfword access.
Note: WIFIWAITCNT can be accessed only when enabled in POWCNT2.

**4000301h - NDS7 - HALTCNT - Low Power Mode Control (R/W)**
In Halt mode, the CPU is paused as long as (IE AND IF)=0.
In Sleep mode, most of the hardware including sound and video are
paused, this very-low-power mode could be used much like a screensaver.

```

|       0-5   Not used (zero)                                           |

|   Power Down Mode  (0=No function, 1=Enter GBA Mode, 2=Halt, 3=Sleep) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The HALTCNT register should not be accessed directly. Instead, the BIOS
Halt, Sleep, CustomHalt, IntrWait, or VBlankIntrWait SWI functions
should be used.
- [BIOS Halt Functions](./bioshaltfunctions.md)
- [ARM CP15 System Control Coprocessor](./armcp15systemcontrolcoprocessor.md)
The NDS9 does not have a HALTCNT register, instead, the Halt function
uses the co-processor opcode \"mcr p15,0,r0,c7,c0,4\" - this opcod
locks up if interrupts are disabled via IME=0 (unlike NDS7 HALTCNT
method which doesn\'t check IME).

**4000300h - NDS7/NDS9 - POSTFLG - BYTE - Post Boot Flag (R/W)**
The NDS7 and NDS9 post boot flags are usually set upon BIOS/Firmware
boot completion, once when set the reset vector is redirected to the
debug handler of Nintendo\'s hardware debugger. That allows the NDS
debugger to capture accidental jumps to address 0, that appears to be a
common problem with HLL-programmers, asm-coders know that (and why) they
should not jump to 0.

|       0     Post Boot Flag (0=Boot in progress, 1=Boot completed)     |
|                                                                       |
|      1     NDS7: Not used (always zero), NDS9: Bit1 is read-writeable |
|       2-7   Not used (always zero)                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

There are some write-restrictions: The NDS7 register can be written to
only from code executed in BIOS (done by NDS boot ROM, or by DSi
firmware, whereas the DSi firmware is using the CpuSet SWI function to
issue the POSTFLG write from within ROM). Bit0 of both NDS7 and NDS9
registers cannot be cleared (except by Reset) once when it is set. DSi
games seem to run regardless of POSTFLG, whilst NDS games somewhat
refuse to run when POSTFLG=0.
