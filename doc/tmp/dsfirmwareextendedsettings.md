# DS Firmware Extended Settings


Extended Settings contain some additional information which is not
supported by the original firmware (current century, date/time formats,
temperature calibration, etc.), the settings are supported by Nocash
Firmware, by the no\$gba emulator, and may be eventually also supporte
by other emulators. If present, the values can be used by games,
otherwise games should use either whatever default settings, or contain
their own configuration menu.

**Extended Settings - loaded to 23FEE00h (aka fragments of NDS9 boot
code)**
