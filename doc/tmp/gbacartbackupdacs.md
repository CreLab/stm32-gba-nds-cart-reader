DACS (Debugging And Communication System) is used in Nintendo\'
hardware debugger only, DACS is NOT used in normal game cartridges.

Parts of DACS memory is used to store the debugging exception handlers
(entry point/size defined in cartridge header), the remaining memory
could be used to store game positions or other data. The address space
is the upper end of the 32MB ROM area, the memory can be read directly
by the CPU, including for ability to execute program code in this area.
