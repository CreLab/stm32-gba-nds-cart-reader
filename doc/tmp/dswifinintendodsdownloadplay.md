# DS Wifi Nintendo DS Download Play


DS Download Play allows to download small games from other NDS/DSi
consoles. This is also known as Wireless Multiboot (WMB), or Single
Gamecart Multiplay.

Before downloading: Receive beacons, display Icon/Title, prompt user
whether to download that title, and, if so, connect to host (via
authentication and association requests). See previous chapter for
details.

**Download process (after authentication/association)**

|       Host sends NameRequests, client(s) send UsernameReply           |
|       Host sends RSA frame, client(s) send RsaReply                   |
|                                                                       |
| Host sends Data (Header/ARM9/ARM7 binaries), client(s) send DataReply |
|                                                                       |
|  Host sends Data, if it's the last packet, client(s) send GotAllReply |
|       Host sends Final message, client(s) send FinalReply             |
|                                                                       |

The whole transfer is done at 2MBit/s, without any WEP/WPA encryption,
and without ARM9 Secure Area encryption.

```

The packet number (and info from RSA frame) allow to compute the packet
destination address. That max packet size is 1F8h bytes (at least so
- when using default Tag=DDh \[14h\]=1FEh).
The transfer is usually done with increasing packet numbers. However,
there may be lost or duplicated packets. And the uploader tends to do
weird things like starting with packet 0001h instead of 0000h, and once
or then inserting packet 0000h (or other unrequested packets) during
transfer.
Essentially, the downloader should maintain a flag array to know which
packets were already received, and which ones still need to be requested
in Data Replys. The uploader should ignore slightly outdated replies
(keep sending the next packet if the wanted packet number is same as
most recently transferred one).

**REPLY, Client to Host Replies (with DA = 03:09:BF:00:00:10)**
Sent via 4808094h/W_TXBUF_REPLY1 (multiplayer slave).

Ideally, software should update the reply immediately after receiving
the command (within a few hundred clock cycles) (when failing to write
W_TXBUF_REPLY1 in time, the hardware does reportedly generate a
completely Empty Dummy Reply with 0-byte data, and FC=0158h).

**CMD ACK, Host to client acknowledgements (with DA =
03:09:BF:00:00:03)**
Generated automatically by hardware (after sending W_TXBUF_CMD and after
receiving Replies) (DA seems to be fully hardcoded in hardware, the
other IEEE header fields might be derived from preceeding RX/TX packets
and/or from hardware registers).

| 2  Error Flags (bit1-15=No reply from Slave 1-15, eg. when AID_LOW=0) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: The SEQNO value in the IEEE header of CMD ACK must be reportedly
one higher than in the corresponding CMD packet (the NDS hardware is
doing that automatically, but one may need to take care of it on non-NDS
hardware).

**RSA signature frame payload (Command 03h)**
\"Notably: the RSA frame itself is not included as part of the dat
being signed, bringing up various security issues and making Nintendo\'
firmware engineers look amateurish at best.\"

```

The temp/actual destination addresses are usually identical, except for
ARM7 which is loaded to a separate temp address in Main RAM (needed
there for computing its SHA1 on ARM9 side).
The RSA signature is as so: First compute SHA1\'s on Header and ARM9 an
ARM7 areas, and store them in a 40h-byte array:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h 14h SHA1 on Header                                          |
|       14h 14h SHA1 on ARM9 bootcode                                   |
|       28h 14h SHA1 on ARM7 bootcode                                   |
- |       3Ch 4   Signature Seed (same as the four bytes from [C0h])      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Then compute a SHA1 on that 40h-byte array, that SHA1 value is then used
in the RSA signature (in OpenPGP SHA1 format, ie. same as SWI 23h in DSi
BIOS). The RSA private key is unknown, the RSA public key
(9Eh,C1h,CCh,C0h,\...) can be found in the NDS Firmware and in th
DSi\'s DS Download Play utility.
Unknown if the 4-byte Seed value is having any special meaning (eg. it
might be some checksum, or it might be just some random, timestamp, or
dummy expiredate?).
- The 4+80h+4 signature bytes at \[3Ch..C3h\] are conventionally stored a
the \"end\" of the binary, ie. at the offset specified i
- cartheader\[080h\].

**160h-byte Header**
Some Download Play titles have faulty header entries (eg. Table Hockey
Tech Demo, with nonsense Icon offset etc). In such cases, dumps are
conventionally having a manually repaired header & an extra copy of the
original header:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000h 1                                                         |
| 60h  Repaired Header (address/size/entrypoint for ARM9,ARM7,Icon,RSA) |
|       0160h A0h   Zerofilled                                          |
|       0200h 10h   ID "DS DOWNLOAD PLAY" (8bit characters)             |
|       0210h 10h   ID "----------------" (8bit characters)             |
|       0220h 160h  Original Header (to be uploaded for RSA check)      |
|       0380h 10h   ID "----------------" (8bit characters)             |
|       0390h 10h   ID "Nintendo"         (16bit characters)            |
|       03A0h 10h   ID Zerofilled                                       |
|       03B0h 10h   ID "----------------" (8bit characters)             |
|       03C0h ..    Zerofilled                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The 160h-byte Header itself is about same as in ROM-images. The
Icon/Title entry contains the information that is broadcast in Beacons.
The Total Size entry points to the 88h-byte RSA Signature. The
File/Overlay entries contain unused/dummy values.

**Beacons**
Beacons should be kept sent during transfer, however, the DS Download
tool throws a Deauth message when receiving more than 15 beacons with
data traffic (ie. one must pause uploading at least each 16th beacon).
Also, the download should try to sync itself to the LCD Video Sync value
in the Beacon (supposedly interpreted relative to the IEEE Beacon
Timestamp) (with small uploads, there\'s probably not enough time t
complete the synchronization, so the uploaded executable may still have
to finish the synchronization by itself).

**Entrypoint/Memory**
The Entrypoints are supposedly taken from the RSA frame (not from the
160h-byte header)? There is some error checking on the RSA frame
addresses (eg. ARM7 area must exist and must apparently point to RAM or
WRAM). Additionally, there is some special info in RAM:

Multiplayer games can use that info for communicating with each other
after the upload. The player number (needed for more than 2 players)
doesn\'t seem to be included in that structure, it might be still i
W_AID_LOW though?
