# DS Cart DLDI Driver


DLDI (Dynamically Linked Device Interface for libfat) is a popular yet
undocumented flashcart driver for homebrew NDS software dating back to
2006. Below was reverse-engineered 11/2018.

file.dldi \--\> driver file (can be small like 1.5Kbyte, or ma
32Kbyte)
file.nds \--\> ROM image (must contain 32Kbyte space with DLDI ID fo
patching)

- Note: The allocated driver size in hdr\[0Fh\] was 0Fh=32Kbytes betwee
2006 and 2016, however, libnds has changed that to 0Eh=16Kbytes in
January 2017 (maybe intending to free more RAM, especially when using
ARM7 WRAM).
However, there\'s at least one driver exceeding 16K (rpg_nand.dldi i
- AKAIO package; the driver disguises itself as 8K driver in hdr\[0Dh\]
but its BSS area actually needs ways MORE than 16K).

**Required entries in .nds file**
Officially, dldi could be at any 4-byte aligned location, however, for
faster lookup, better use this locations:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       dl                                                              |
| di area should be located at a 40h-byte aligned address in ROM image. |
|       dldi area should be located in ARM9 (or ARM7) bootcode area.    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

An \"empty\" driver needs to contain:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       dldi[00h..0Bh] must contain DLDI ID word/string                 |
|       dl                                                              |
- | di[0Fh]      must contain allocated size (0Eh=16Kbyte or 0Fh=32Kbyte) |
- |       dldi[40h..43h] must contain RAM base address of DLDI block      |
|       and                                                             |
| other entries should contain valid dummy strings and dummy functions. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

An installed driver should contain a copy of the .dldi file, with
addresses adjusted to RAM locations, and BSS area zerofilled (if FIX_BSS
was set)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- | dldi[0Fh] must be kept as in the old .nds file (not as in .dldi file) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Some installers might try to detect homebrew by looking at nds carthdr
for deciding whether or not to try to install dldi (unknown if/which
ones are doing such things and looking at which carthdr entries).

**Functions**
startup, isInserted, clearStatus, shutdown can be dummy functions that
do nothing (other than returning r0=1=okay).
Alternately startup/shutdown can initialize or power down the hardware,
clearStatus is meant to be some sort of soft reset, and isInserted is
allowing to test if the SD card is inserted & working.
read/write sectors are reading/writing one or more sectors. Sector size
is 200h bytes, sector numbers is 0=First 200h bytes, 1=Next 200h bytes,
and so on.
buf should be usually 4-byte aligned, however, some drivers do also
support unaligned buffers using slower transfer code (better implement
that when making .dldi drivers, but better don\'t rely on it bein
supported when making .nds files).
The driver functions can support SD and SDHC (or the flashcart
manufacturer might release driver updates if SDHC wasn\'t supported).
Higher level FAT functions must be contained in the .nds file (so a
driver update won\'t help if the .nds file lacks FAT32) (and ExFAT mos
unlikely to be supported).
Functions should be ARM7 compatible, ie. don\'t use BLX or POP r15 fo
mode switching, so the driver can be used on both ARM9 and ARM7 (or even
on GBA).

**SLOT_GBA/NDS**
SLOT_GBA/NDS seem to relate to GBA and NDS slots, the driver can
probably have only one of the SLOT bits set (the functions don\'t allo
to select which slot to use).
Purpose is unclear to me, maybe just telling the .nds file that the
flashcart is in the given slot (and thereby shouldn\'t expect othe
hardware in that slot). Or maybe telling telling the installer which
hardware the driver is supposed for.

FIX_xxx does maybe relate to address adjustments made by the dldi
installer. Unknown if/how that\'s working.
- [DS Cart DLDI Driver - GuessedAddress-Adjustments](./dscartdldidriverguessedaddressadjustments.md)

Some DLDI flashcarts support extra features like Rumble. However, that
extra hardware is accessed via direct I/O, not via DLDI driver. Unknown
which I/O ports are used for that stuff - probably something compatible
with official GBA/NDS rumble cart(s).
