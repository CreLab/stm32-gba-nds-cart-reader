# LCD I/O BG Rotation/Scaling


### 4000028h - BG2X_L - BG2 Reference Point X-Coordinate, lower 16 bit (W)
### 400002Ah - BG2X_H - BG2 Reference Point X-Coordinate, upper 12 bit (W)
### 400002Ch - BG2Y_L - BG2 Reference Point Y-Coordinate, lower 16 bit (W)
### 400002Eh - BG2Y_H - BG2 Reference Point Y-Coordinate, upper 12 bit (W)
These registers are replacing the BG scrolling registers which are used for Text mode, ie. the X/Y coordinates specify the source position from inside of the BG Map/Bitmap of the pixel to be displayed at upper left of the GBA display. The normal BG scrolling registers are ignored in Rotation/Scaling and Bitmap modes.

Because values are shifted left by eight, fractional portions may be specified in steps of 1/256 pixels (this would be relevant only if the screen is actually rotated or scaled). Normal signed 32bit values may be written to above registers (the most significant bits will be ignored and the value will be cut-down to 28bits, but this is no actual problem because signed values have set all MSBs to the same value).

### Internal Reference Point Registers
The above reference points are automatically copied to internal registers during each vblank, specifying the origin for the first scanline. The internal registers are then incremented by dmx and dmy after each scanline.
Caution: Writing to a reference point register by software outside of the Vblank period does immediately copy the new value to the corresponding internal register, that means: in the current frame, the new value specifies the origin of the \<current\> scanline (instead of the topmost scanline).

### 400003Xh - BG3X_L/H, BG3Y_L/H, BG3PA-D - BG3 Rotation/Scaling Parameters
Same as above BG2 Reference Point, and Rotation/Scaling Parameters, for BG3 respectively.

### dx (PA) and dy (PC)
When transforming a horizontal line, dx and dy specify the resulting gradient and magnification for that line. For example:
Horizontal line, length=100, dx=1, and dy=1. The resulting line would be drawn at 45 degrees, f(y)=1/1\*x. Note that this would involve that line is magnified, the new length is SQR(100\^2+100\^2)=141.42. Yup, exactly - that\'s the old a\^2 + b\^2 = c\^2 formula.

### dmx (PB) and dmy (PD)
These values define the resulting gradient and magnification for transformation of vertical lines. However, when rotating a square area (which is surrounded by horizontal and vertical lines), then the desired result should be usually a rotated \<square\> area (ie. not a parallelogram, for example).
Thus, dmx and dmy must be defined in direct relationship to dx and dy, taking the example above, we\'d have to set dmx=-1, and dmy=1, f(x)=-1/1\*y.

### Area Overflow
In result of rotation/scaling it may often happen that areas outside of the actual BG area become moved into the LCD viewport. Depending of the Area Overflow bit (BG2CNT and BG3CNT, Bit 13) these areas may be either displayed (by wrapping the BG area), or may be displayed transparent.
This works only in BG modes 1 and 2. The area overflow is ignored in Bitmap modes (BG modes 3-5), the outside of the Bitmaps is always transparent.

### The following parameters are required for Rotation/Scaling

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Rotation Center X and Y Coordinates (x0,y0)                     |
|       Rotation Angle                      (alpha)                     |
|       Magnification X and Y Values        (xMag,yMag)                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The display is rotated by \'alpha\' degrees around the center.
The displayed picture is magnified by \'xMag\' along x-Axis (Y=y0) and \'yMag\' along y-Axis (X=x0).

### Calculating Rotation/Scaling Parameters A-D

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       A = Cos (alpha) / xMag    ;distance moved in direction x, same line |
|       B = Sin (alpha) / xMag    ;distance moved in direction x, next line |
|       C = Sin (alpha) / yMag    ;distance moved in direction y, same line |
|       D = Cos (alpha) / yMag    ;distance moved in direction y, next line |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Calculating the position of a rotated/scaled dot
Using the following expressions,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       x0,y0    Rotation Center                                        |
|       x1,y1    Old Position of a pixel (before rotation/scaling)      |
|       x2,y2    New position of above pixel (after rotation scaling)   |
|       A,B,C,D  BG2PA-BG2PD Parameters (as calculated above)           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

the following formula can be used to calculate x2,y2:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       x2 = A(x1-x0) + B(y1-y0) + x0                                   |
|       y2 = C(x1-x0) + D(y1-y0) + y0                                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
