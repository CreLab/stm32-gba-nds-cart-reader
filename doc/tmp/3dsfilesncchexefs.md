# 3DS Files - NCCH ExeFS


### ExeFS Header (max 10 files)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 10h*10  File headers for File 1..10        ;First at 000h  |
|       0A0h 20h     Reserved                                           |
|       0C0h 20h*10  SHA256 Hash for File 10..1         ;First at 1E0h  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

File hashes are stored in reverse order, i.e. the hash at offset 1E0h corresponds to the first ExeFS section.
Each file header has a corresponding file hash, which is the SHA256 hash calculated over the entire file contents.

### File headers
There are a maximum of 10 file headers in the ExeFS format (the maximum number of file headers is disputable, with makerom indicating a maximum of 8 sections and makecia indicating a maximum of 10 (uh, are homebrew tools?). From a non-SDK point of view, the ExeFS header format can hold no more than 10 file headers within the currently define size of 200h bytes). The file headers have the following structure:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h 8     File name (ASCII, zeropadded) (all 00h for unused entries)      |
|       08h 4     File offset in bytes (0=Right after the 200h-byte ExeFS Header) |
|       0Ch 4     File size in bytes                                              |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

File offsets are non-inclusive of the header\'s size (200h bytes). Also, file headers which are not used are filled with all zeros.
The file offsets should be 200h-byte aligned. The file size is usually 4-byte aligned (unknown if that is actually required).

### ExeFS Files
ExeFS or Executable Filesystem contains information related to the executable program, and is the part of the CXI format.
The ExeFS usually contains one or more of the following files:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       .code   Contains ARM11 code, which can be optionally                  |
|                 reverse-LZSS compressed via an exheader flag.               |
|       .firm   Contains FIRM with ARM9/ARM11 code (usually plus some NCCH's) |
|       logo    Contains distribution licensing Binary data                   |
|       banner  Contains the banner which homemenu uses for this CXI          |
|       icon    Contains the icon which homemenu displays for this CXI        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### .code (ARM11)
The .code file does simply contain plain code/data without any file header (instead, the .code file\'s load addresses and compression flag are located in the NCCH Exheader).
For the LZrev decompression function, see:
- [LZ Decompression Functions](./lzdecompressionfunctions.md)
The (decompressed) filesize should be a multiple of 1000h bytes (and the code/const/data sections should be on 1000h-byte page boundaries, as specified in the NCCH Exheader).

### .code (GBA)
The .code files for GBA games do reportedly contain the GBA ROM-image, with an extra GBA Footer (with info on cartridge type and preferred LCD color scheme). For details:

Unknown if GBA games have specific entries in NCCH header/exheader.
