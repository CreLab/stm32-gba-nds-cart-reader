# DS Cart Infrared Activity Meter IR Commands


**Packet Encryption/Checksumming**
Nintendo wants all IR packet bytes to be \"encrypted\" (XORed by AAh)
that encryption/decryption must be done on ARM side. The checksums are
calculated as so (on decrypted packets):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       sum=0, packet[2,3]=00h,00h                    ;-initial chksum  |
|       for i=0 to size-1                                               |
|         if                                                            |
- |  (i and 1)=0 then sum=sum+packet[i]*100h  ;\add in big-endian fashion 
- |         if (i and 1)=1 then sum=sum+packet[i]       ;/                |
|       sum=(sum/10000h)+(sum AND FFFFh)              ;\final adjust    
|       sum=(sum/10000h)+(sum)                        ;/                |
|       p                                                               |
- | acket[2,3]=sum,sum/100h                      ;-store in little-endian |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The packets are transferred at 115200 baud, 8n1. End of Packet is
indicated by a pause in the IR transmission (that does also indicate the
packet size).
Before sending a command packet, one should always wait for incoming
data from the Activity Meter (ie. for the FCh byte, or for
Reply/ChecksumError responses for previous command).

There aren\'t any specific commands for reading things like ste
counters, one must instead use the Memory Read/Write commands with
hardcoded RAM or EEPROM address, see:
- [DS Cart Infrared Activity Meter MemoryMap](./dscartinfraredactivitymetermemorymap.md)
The command/reply are intended to be transferred from/to NDS
accordingly, but things could go wrong if there are multiple consoles or
activity meters (all trying to process the same message, or even
mistreating replies as commands).
The infrared range (distance/angle) is unknown. Dumping the whole 64K
CPU memory space worked without checksum errors at about 5-10cm distance
(and that worked without even using the Connect command).
