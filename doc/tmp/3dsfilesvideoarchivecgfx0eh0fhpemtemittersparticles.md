Then there comes some more stuff at offset 0E0h (which might be addressed via Offset 24h stored at \[0BCh\] in above structure?). That extra data can somehow vary randomly with/without DICT at different locations (it seems to be related on \"Flags\" in first which can be 04000000h, 10000000h, 20000000h, 40000000h, 80000000h, although there are two variants for Flags=20000000h).
Unknown how that makes sense\... maybe some of the below stuff is totally unrelated to PEMT (ie. it might be referenced from somewhere else, and just happens to be located after PEMT).

3DS Camera RomFS:\\effect\\P.pack\\ScoreE.bcptlLZ has three variants with DICT (all in one file).

Then comes the DICT (unless type is 04000000h)\... the DICT is containing whatever\... it can have MANY entries, in unknown format(s).

### Variant without DICT and Flags=04000000h
As found in Mii Maker RomFS:\\effect\\..\\QR00.bcptl

```

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Variant without DICT and Flags=20000000h (despite same Flags can have DICT)
And Mii Maker also has some file with yet smaller DICT-less block, but with 20000000h (which usuallly DOES have DICT, but not in this case).

Some of the DICT-less variants seem to contain two bytes (rather than a whole 32bit word) in last entry? Usually that\'s padded to 32bit alignment, but not in the last entry (which occurs right before the string table, which can start at a non-aligned location).
