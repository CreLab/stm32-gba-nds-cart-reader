Then there comes some more stuff at offset 0E0h (which might be
- addressed via Offset 24h stored at \[0BCh\] in above structure?). Tha
extra data can somehow vary randomly with/without DICT at different
locations (it seems to be related on \"Flags\" in first which can b
04000000h, 10000000h, 20000000h, 40000000h, 80000000h, although there
are two variants for Flags=20000000h).
Unknown how that makes sense\... maybe some of the below stuff i
totally unrelated to PEMT (ie. it might be referenced from somewhere
else, and just happens to be located after PEMT).

3DS Camera RomFS:\\effect\\P.pack\\ScoreE.bcptlLZ has three variant
with DICT (all in one file).

Then comes the DICT (unless type is 04000000h)\... the DICT i
containing whatever\... it can have MANY entries, in unknown format(s).

Some of the DICT-less variants seem to contain two bytes (rather than a
whole 32bit word) in last entry? Usually that\'s padded to 32bi
alignment, but not in the last entry (which occurs right before the
string table, which can start at a non-aligned location).
