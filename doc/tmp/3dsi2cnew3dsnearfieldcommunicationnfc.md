# 3DS I2C New3DS Near-Field Communication (NFC)


**I2C Bus/Device 1:EEh - Near-Field Communication (NFC) (New3DS-only)**
This device is transferring command/response packets on the I2C bus (so
one must only transfer Device+Data bytes; without any register Index
values).

**Datasheets and Specs**
The NFC controller appears to be a 32pin Broadcom BCM20791 chip, there
is no datasheet for that chip, however, a datasheet for 34pin BCM20793S
chip does exist, but unfortunately without any specs on the transfer
protocol.
Specifications for the lower-level transfer protocol (and maybe even the
I2C bus protocol?) are made by the \"NFC Forum\" (a non-profi
organization that charges lots of money for a copy of those specs).
There is some android open source code for \"bcm2079x\" available.

**New3DS Transfer Protocol\...**
Command request / response structure:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h 1     Normally 10h?                                         |
|       01h 1     Command source / destination                          |
|       02h 1     CmdID                                                 |
|       03h 1     Payload size (LEN)                                    |
|       04h LEN   Data/parameters                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


The command response payload is usually at least 1-byte, where that byte
appears to be normally 00h. For command requests the payload data is the
command parameters.

- For command requests sent to the NFC tag itself, Cmd\[1\]=0x0 an
CmdID=0x0. The command request payload data here is the actual command
request data for the NFC tag, starting with the CmdID u8 at payload+0.

During NFC module startup, a certain command (?) is sent to the
controller which eventually (after various cmd-reply headers etc)
returns the following after the first byte in the payload:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000                                                            |
| 00: 44 65 63 20 32 32 20 32 30 31 32 31 34 3a 35 33  Dec 22 201214:53 |
|       0000                                                            |
| 10: 3a 35 30 01 05 0d 46 05 1b 79 20 07 32 30 37 39  :50...F..y .2079 |
|       000020: 31 42 35                                         1B5    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Or that is: \"Dec 22 201214:53:50\<binary\>20791B5\". Therefore, thi
appears to return the part-number of the NFC controller (other command
request(s) / response(s) use this part-number value too).
Actually, 20791B5 seems to be NFC certification number for an
unspecified Broadcom product (or possibly 20791B5 is the product name
itself\... yes, apparently it\'s Broadcom BCM20791).
Protocol = NFC Forum NFC Controller Interface (NCI) for host interface

**NFC controller commands**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       CmdRequest[1, uh?]  CmdID   Payload data for parameters         |
|       2E                                                              |
| h                 2Fh     Firmware image for this chunk, size varies. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This is used during NFC module startup to upload the firmware image to
the NFC controller. This is used repeatedly to upload multiple chunks of
the image.

**Power-up**
After power-up, the NFC chip automatically sends these bytes upon I2C
reads:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       10 60 00 02 00 01     ;followed by endless FF bytes             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

That seems to be a 4-byte header, with 2-byte data, as indicated in
- hdr\[3\]=02h.

**NFC Interrupt**
Triggers when there is data available for reading. Unknown if there is
also a way for determining if the thing is ready for writing a new
command\... maybe one should simply wait for a response packet afte
sending any command packets?

**Old3DS Version**
The Old3DS did have an external NFC Adapter add-on, accessed via IrDA.
- [3DS NFC Adapter](./3dsnfcadapter.md)
The 3DS OS is supposedly having backwards/forwards compatible NFC
functions, but the underlying transfer protocol seems to be completely
different (relying on IrDA to communicate with the adpater firmare,
instead of directly accessing the BCM20791 chip).
