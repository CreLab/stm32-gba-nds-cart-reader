# DS Wifi Multiplay Slave


The slave mode is activated by setting W_AID_LOW to a nonzero value (the
slave number in range 1..15). That settings specifies that (and when) to
send replies to incoming commands.

The replies are queued in W_TXBUF_REPLY1 (next packet) and
W_TXBUF_REPLY2 (readonly, current packet).
Software does usually write to the REPLY1 register. Upon incomings
CMD\'s, the hardware does automatically forward REPLY1 to REPLY2 (an
reset REPLY1 to 0000h).
Because of that queuing, one should use two alternating Wifi RAM
locations (ie. don\'t overwrite the current packet when preparing th
next packet).
Alternately, one can manually forward REPLY1 to REPLY2 (via
W_RXCNT.bit7, but that\'s normally not needed, except maybe for thing
like manually resetting REPLY2).

These registers are used for multiplay client-to-host (aka slave to
master) responses.

Note: W_TXBUF_REPLY2.Bit15 is NOT cleared after SENDING the reply
(instead, REPLY2 gets overwritten by REPLY1 when RECEIVING the next
CMD).

```



**on client side**
The reply transfer is automatically initiated when receiving a MP CMD
frame (this seems to be based on the incoming IEEE header\'s fram
control value and/or broadcast address, CMD frames typically have
FC=0228h).

When receiving the MP CMD frame, the hardware determines its position
using its W_AID_LOW register and the frame\'s client bitmask, then wait
for its turn to reply.

W_TXBUF_REPLY1 is latched into W_TXBUF_REPLY2, and reset to zero.
- The byte at TXHDR\[04h\] is set incremented. Nintendo software check
for this.

when transferring the MP reply itself:
IRQ7 is triggered. W_RF_STATUS is 8.
at the end: if W_TXSTATCNT.bit12=1, W_TXSTAT is set to 0401h, and IRQ1
is triggered.

**Reportedly\...**
It will always send a reply - if W_TXBUF_REPLY1 isn\'t configured, i
will send an empty reply frame (with frame control 0x0158). W_RXTXADDR
isn\'t modified when sending a default empty reply.
