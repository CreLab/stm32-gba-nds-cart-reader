# 3DS eMMC and MCU Images


**eMMC Images**
no\$gba can load 3DS eMMC images from following files in no\$gba folde
(currently that merely allows to view eMMC images in Window/Filesystem,
ie. there isn\'t any actual 3DS emulation supported in no\$gba):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3DS-#.mmc      ;\with "#" being the machine number ("1".."C")   
|       New3DS-#.mmc   ;/                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For decrypting the image, CID and OTP needs to be stored at following
eMMC offsets:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       DC00h 20h   ID '3DS CID/OTP/NCSD/FIRM BackupData'               |
|       DC20h 10h   eMMC CID (from eMMC command CMD10)                  |
|       DC30h D0h   Reserved                                            |
|       DD00h 100h  OTP   (from ARM9 I/O address 10012000h)             |
|       DE00h 200h  Copy of original NCSD  (from eMMC offset 00000000h) |
|       E000h 1000h Copy of original FIRM0 (from eMMC offset 0B130000h) |
|       F000h 1000h Copy of original FIRM1 (from eMMC offset 0B530000h) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The copy of original NCSD/FIRM0/FIRM1 allows to uninstall sighax-based
stuff (or to install such stuff; doing that works even without having
OTP dump, as long as the unencrypted content of the NCSD/FIRM0/FIRM1
sectors is known).

**MCU Firmware Images**
The MCU image can be viewed in no\$gba\'s RL78 disassembler (via Alt+W
R). The image is loaded from following files in no\$gba directory:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3DS.mcu                                                         |
|       New3DS.mcu                                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The file should contain a copy of the whole 8000h-byte MCU flash
memory:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000h 1000h Part 1 current version                              |
|       1000h 1000h Part 1 old version backup                           |
|       2000h 3000h Part 2 current version                              |
|       5000h 3000h Part 2 old version backup                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If the old version areas aren\'t dumped, best leave them empty.

**Atheros Wifi ROM image**
The Wifi ROM image can be viewed in no\$gba\'s Xtensa disassembler (vi
Alt+W, X). The image is loaded from following file (in no\$gb
directory):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       AR6014G.ROM  ;3DS wifi chip     (256Kbytes)                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
