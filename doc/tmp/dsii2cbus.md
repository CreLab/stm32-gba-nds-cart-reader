# DSi I2C Bus


**I2C Bus**
- [DSi I2C I/O Ports](./dsii2cioports.md)
- [DSi I2C Signals](./dsii2csignals.md)

**Device 4Ah (BPTWL chip) (LED/Volume/Powerbutton/Reset)**
- [DSi I2C Device 4Ah (./dsii2cdevice4ahbptwlchip.md)

**Device 78h/7Ah (Aptina MT9V113 Cameras)**
- [DSi Aptina Camera Initialization](./dsiaptinacamerainitialization.md)
Directly addressed I2C Registers (16bit index, 16bit data):
- [DSi Aptina Camera Registers: SYSCTL(./dsiaptinacameraregisterssysctl0000h0051h.md)
- [DSi Aptina Camera Registers: RX_SS, FUSE, XDMA(./dsiaptinacameraregistersrxssfusexdma0100h099fh.md)
- [DSi Aptina Camera Registers: CORE (3000h-31FFh,38xxh)](./dsiaptinacameraregisterscore3000h31ffh38xxh.md)
- [DSi Aptina Camera Registers: SOC1(./dsiaptinacameraregisterssoc13210h33fdh.md)
- [DSi Aptina Camera Registers: SOC2(./dsiaptinacameraregisterssoc23400h3729h.md)
Indirectly addressed MCU Variables (via above \"XDMA\" commands):
- [DSi Aptina Camera Variables: RAM/SFR/MON (GPIO/Monitor)(./dsiaptinacameravariablesramsfrmongpiomonitormcu0000h20xxh.md)
- [DSi Aptina Camera Variables: SEQ (Sequencer)(./dsiaptinacameravariablesseqsequencermcu21xxh.md)

- [DSi Aptina Camera Variables: HG (Histogram)(./dsiaptinacameravariableshghistogrammcu2bxxh.md)
I2C Bus Caution: The Camera I2C access requires the \"16.76MHz Camer
External Clock\" enabled in Port 4004004h.Bit8 on ARM9 Side. Fo
accessing registers other than SYSCTL/CORE, one must also clear the
- Standby flag in SYSCTL\[0018h\].

**Device A0h/E0h (Unknown, maybe cameras from other manufacturer)**
- [DSi Alternate Cameras from UnknownManufacturer](./dsialternatecamerasfromunknownmanufacturer.md)

**Camera Data Transfers**
Camera configuration is done on ARM7 side via serial I2C bus. However,
the actual Camera Data transfers are done on ARM9 side through 8bit
parallel bus:
- [DSi Cameras](./dsicameras.md)

**Broken Cameras (defunct device 78h/7Ah/A0h/E0h)**
Consoles should contain two Aptina cameras, or two Unknown cameras. The
Unlaunch installer is throwing a warning when detecting Unknown cameras,
so far nobody has reported that case, so Unknown cameras seem to be very
rare (if they were ever used at all). However, two people reported that
warning showing FFh\'s in the ID bytes for most or all cameras (cause
by a broken camera with only one working camera, or broken camera
connector with no working cameras at all).
Bottom line is that broken cameras are more common than unknown cameras,
and games with optional/extra camera features should support that
situation: ie. disable the feature in case of broken camera(s) instead
of becoming unplayable.

**Device 90h (Whatever)**
Trying to read I2C for this device just returns FFh? Maybe exists in
debug version only. The firmware contains a few functions for accessing
this register.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Register  Width   Description                                   |
|       02h       1       Used for DSi IRQ6 IF flags                    |
|                           uh, IF.Bit6 would be Timer3overflow ?       |
|                           or, IF2.Bit6 would be PowerButton ?         |
|       04h       1       Unknown (bit0 toggled)                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unknown purpose.

**Device 40h (Whatever) (and New3DS QTM)**
Trying to read I2C for this device just returns FFh? Maybe exists in
debug version only. The firmware doesn\'t use this register (it doe
only contain the device number in the device table).
Caution: New3DS does use device number 40h for the QTM IO Expander, this
device will be visible in DSi mode (and shouldn\'t be mistaken fo
whatever DSi device 40h was originally used for).

There are also some internal/secondary I2C busses (not connected to the
ARM CPUs).
