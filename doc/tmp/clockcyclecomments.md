# Clock Cycle Comments


The normal execution time for one GBA opcode ranges between 1 and 100
(!) clock cycles, or more. Unfortunately, opcode execution time depends
on various of circumstances (bus widths, waitstates, etc.), which is
making it rather difficult to count cycles by hand, or just to a get
feeling for efficient GBA code.

The no\$gba Clock Cycle Comments feature displays the execution time fo
each opcode in disassembler window. Four different view modes
(selectable in setup) are available:

**Short Formula, and Detailed Formula**
Short Formula: Displays the Non-sequential, Sequential, and Internal
cycles (eg. 2N+3S+1I). Detailed Formula: Splits the N and S cycles into
code and data access (eg. 1N+1S+1ND+2SD+1I, N/S for code, ND/SD for
data).

**Cycles, and Cycles & Sum**
Cycles: Displays the number of clock cycles (by resolving the above
formula - recursing operand size, opcode and data addresses, and current
waitstate configuration). Cycles & Sum: Additionally displays the sum of
all opcodes on screen in a second column (to use that feature, simply
scroll the first line of interest to topmost screen position).

Even though these features are making it much easier to count cycles,
there are still some restrictions which should be kept in mind:

**Data access (load/store opcodes) - Important**
Cycles are resolved by current register settings. For example, the
- execution time for \"LDR Rd,\[Rb\]\" could be resolved correctly only i
Rb is currently pointing to the same memory area as when executing that
opcode (that is valid if the program counter points to the opcode, for
stack accesses by r13 register it\'d be usually always valid).

**Prefetch**
Game-Pak Prefetch isn\'t yet understood or supported. If it is enable
in WAITCNT register, access to cartridge ROM may take up less cycles as
displayed in clock cycle comments.

**Conditional Opcodes**
Conditional opcodes are always assumed to be true (unless if the program
counter points to the opcode, in that case the actual execution time is
displayed, ie. 1S if the condition is false).

**Sums**
The Cycles & Sums features simply adds one execution time to another,
useful for fragments of code, but of course not aware of loops or
skips.

**Jumps**
Execution time for branch opcodes is incorrectly displayed by using
local waitstates for local code area (rather than target area). However,
intersegment jumps (from one memory area to another) are typically
consisting of a call-return combination (ie. the overall execution time
would be correct, but the execution times of the call and return opcodes
would be exchanged).

**VRAM Waitstates**
VRAM Waitstates are not displayed (the real hardware would occasionally
add 1 cycle for accesses to video memory).
