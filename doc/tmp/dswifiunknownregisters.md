# DS Wifi Unknown Registers


**480800Ah - W_X_00Ah (R/W)**

- \"\[bit7 - ingore rx duplicates\]\" \<\-\-- that is NOT correct (n
effect).
Firmware writes 0000h to it. That, done many times. So, eventually some
bits in this register are automatically set by hardware in whatever
situations, otherwise repeatedly writing 0000h to it would be kinda
useless\...?

\-\--

Below Ports W_X_244h and W_X_228h might be related to deciding when to
send multiplay replies\...?

- **4808244h - W_X_244h (R/W) x ffff \[0000\] (used by firmware part4)**
Unknown. Seems to be W_IF/W_IE related. Firmware sets Port 4808244h bits
6,7,12 to 1-then-0 upon IRQ06,IRQ07,IRQ12 respectively.

- **4808228h - W_X_228h (W) fixx \[0000\] (used by firmware part4
(bit3)**
Unknown. Firmware writes 8-then-0 (done in IRQ06 handler, after Port
4808244h access).

\-\--

Below Ports 48081A0h, 48081A2h, 48081A4h are somehow related to
- BB\[02h\]\...

- **48081A0h - W_X_1A0h - (R/W) -933 \[0000\]**

Firmware writes values 000h, 823h. Seems to be power-related. The
following experimental code toggles RXTX.ON (RFU.Pin4): \"x=0 / @@lop: 
- \[48081A0h\]=x / \[4808036h\]=0 / x=x XOR 3 / wait_by_loop(1000h) / 
@@lop\".
Also, writing to port 48081A0h affects ports 4808034h, 480819Ch,
480821Ch, and 48082A2h.

- **48081A2h - W_X_1A2h - (R/W) \-\--3 \[0001\] (used by firmwar
part4)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-1   Unknown. Firmware writes values 03h, 01h, and VAR.        |
|       2-15  Always zero                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Used in combination with Port 48081A0h, so it\'s probably power-related
too.

- **48081A4h - W_X_1A4h - (R/W) ffff \[0000\]**
\"Rate used when signal test is enabled (0x0A or 0x14 for 1 or 
mbit)\"
(Not too sure if that\'s correct, there is no visible relation to an
rate.)
(This register seems to be R/W only on certain Port 48081A0h settings.)
Unknown. Firmware writes whatever.

**4808220h - W_RAM_DISABLE - RAM Control (R/W)**

```

```


**4808290h - W_X_290h - (R/W or Disabled)**
Reportedly, this is the \"antenna\" register, which should exist o
official devkits, allowing to switch between wired Ethernet, and
wireless Wifi mode.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     Unknown (R/W) (if present)                                |
|       1-15  Not used                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

On normal NDS release versions, this register seems to be disabled (if
it is implemented at all), and trying to read from it acts as for unused
registers, ie. reads return FFFFh (or probably 0000h on NDS-lite). The
NDS firmware contains code for accessing this port, even in release
versions.

**W_INTERNAL**
All registers marked as \"W_INTERNAL\" aren\'t used by Firmware part4
and are probably unimportant, except for whatever special diagnostics
purposes.

**Wifi DMA**
Wifi RAM can be accessed with normal \"Start Immediately\" DMA transfer
(typically by reading through W_RXBUF_RD_DATA, so the DMA automatically
wraps from END to BEGIN).
Additionally, DMA0 and DMA2 can be reportedly synchronized to \"Wireles
Interrupt\" (rather than using \"Start Immediately\" timing), no ide
if/how that\'s working though\... and if it gets started on any Wif
IRQ, or only on specific IRQs\...?
Possibly some of the above unknown registers, or some unknown bits in
other registers, are DMA related\...?
Reportedly, early firmwares did use \"Wireless Interrupt\" DMAs (that\'
be firmware v1/v2\... or, only earlier unreleased prototype versions?).
