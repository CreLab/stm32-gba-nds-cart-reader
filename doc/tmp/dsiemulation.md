# DSi Emulation


**Activating DSi emulation (disabled by default)**
The DSi emulation is still DISABLED by default, and must be enabled
manually by setting the \"NDS Mode/Colors\" option to \"DS
(retail/16MB)\".
The reason is that DSi-enhanced games may run into troubles in DSi
emulation mode (but should work fine in NDS emulation mode).

**DSi eMMC bootcode emulation**
Using that emulation feature requires DSi BIOS dumps, eMMC dump, and
Wifi-Flash dump.
The lower 32K halves of the ARM7/ARM9 BIOSes can be dumped quite easily
(if you have any working DSi exploit), the DSi keys in upper 32K halves
can be dumped indirectly (via simple exploits on 3DS, or via difficult
main memory hacks on DSi). For details, see:
- [BIOS Dumping](./biosdumping.md)
For the ROM filenames, see:
- [Installation](./installation.md)
Getting the eMMC image require a DSiware exploit (eg. for DSi Camera, or
Flipnote) (or hardmod), the image must include a footer with CID/CPU IDs
(needed for decryption; obviously those IDs will also tell Nintendo
\'who you are\', in case you should consider leaking your eMMC dump)
For details, see:
- [DSi SD/MMC Images](./dsisdmmcimages.md)
- [DSi Console IDs](./dsiconsoleids.md)
- [AUX DSi SD/MMC Pin-Outs](./auxdsisdmmcpinouts.md)
Optionally, a copy of the DSi Wifi Flash can be stored in file
\"WIFI-DSI.BIN\" (should be usually 128Kbytes; or, reportedly it\'
smaller on newer DSi\'s). That file only contains only some stuff lik
wifi calibration values, no\$gba is auto-generating some dumm
calibration values if the file is missing (so the file is needed only if
you want to do something like experimenting with different calibration
settings).
If needed, the Wifi Flash can be dumped via SPI bus wiring (from wifi
daughterboard), or via raw software (in case you can run NDS or DSi
programs on your DSi console). For details, see the \"Firmware\
sections (named so because, on NDS, the Wifi Flash did also contain the
firmware):
- [DS Cartridges, Encryption, Firmware](./dscartridgesencryptionfirmware.md)
Then, set the \"Reset/Startup Entrypoint\" option in no\$gba t
\"BIOS\", and load a DSi cartridge or DSiware file (just as a dumm
file, to switch the emulation into DSi mode).

**DSi Atheros Wifi BIOS**
The Atheros Wifi BIOS is loaded from these filenames (in no\$gb
directory):

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|                                                                       |
- |      AR6002G.ROM  ;old DSi wifi chip (80Kbytes)   ;wifi-flash[1FDh]=1 |
|                                                                       |
- |      AR6013G.ROM  ;new DSi wifi chip (256Kbytes)  ;wifi-flash[1FDh]=2 |
|                                                                       |
- |      AR6014G.ROM  ;3DS wifi chip     (256Kbytes)  ;wifi-flash[1FDh]=3 |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

presence of that file doesn\'t affect emulation, it\'s used solely fo
viewing the wifi bios in the disassembler (via menubar, window,
xtensa/wifi). The wifi bios can be dumped via SDIO functions
WINDOW_READ_ADDR and WINDOW_DATA.

**DSi Cartridge emulation**
For DSi ROM images, set the \"Reset/Startup Entrypoint\" to \"Star
Cartridge directly\" (this will skip the eMMC boot process, so yo
don\'t need the eMMC dump, and you might also get away without BIO
dump, or with partial lower BIOS 32K dumps).
Then, load a DSi ROM-image (observe that older dumping tools can dump
only the NDS areas of DSi cartridges; such incomplete dumps won\'t wor
in DSi mode).
Tested are two games: Cooking Coach (not working yet), and System Flaw
(works, but requires cameras for use as \"motion sensors\", so it isn\'
actually playable). Going by reports from other users, most or all other
DSi cartridges aren\'t working yet.

**DSi DSiware emulation**
DSiware games can be exported to SD card, and the SD card files can be
decrypted via homebrew DSi SRL Extract utility (system files can be also
downloaded and decrypted via homebrew NUS Downloader utility).
Loading the decrypted files into no\$gba is currently acting as if th
files were cartridge ROM images (rather than files on eMMC).
Surprisingly, this is actually working to some extent (the games are
loading extra data from ROM, instead of from eMMC, which they should be
usually doing). However, loading/saving game positions appears to be
routed to eMMC (not to cartridge FLASH/EEPROM). Apart from that, most
DSiware games are probably stumbling over this or that unemulated detail
or uninitialized memory area.

**Nothing working?**
Depends on what you want: If you want to play games, then, yes, I don\'
know of any DSi games that are working/playable yet. If you want to do
programming/debugging, then you might find out that almost everything is
more or less working. I don\'t know of any other active DSi devr
though - not too surprising since the DSi is definitely the most
complicated and most unattractive console that I\'ve ever seen.
