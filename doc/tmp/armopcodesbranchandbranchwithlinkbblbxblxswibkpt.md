# ARM Opcodes: Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL, BX, BLX, SWI, BKPT)


### Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL, BLX_imm)
Branch (B) is supposed to jump to a subroutine. Branch with Link is meant to be used to call to a subroutine, return address is then saved in R14.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                                  |
|       31-28  Condition (must be 1111b for BLX)                                      |
|       27-25  Must be "101" for this instruction                                     |
|       24     Opcode (0-1) (or Halfword Offset for BLX)                              |
|               0: B{cond} label    ;branch            PC=PC+8+nn*4                   |
|               1: BL{cond} label   ;branch/link       PC=PC+8+nn*4, LR=PC+4          |
|               H: BLX label ;ARM9  ;branch/link/thumb PC=PC+8+nn*4+H*2, LR=PC+4, T=1 |
|       23-0   nn - Signed Offset, step 4      (-32M..+32M in steps of 4)             |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Branch with Link can be used to \'call\' to a sub-routine, which may then \'return\' by MOV PC,R14 for example.
Execution Time: 2S + 1N
Return: No flags affected.

### Branch and Exchange (BX, BLX_reg)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                                 |
|       31-28  Condition                                                             |
|       27-8   Must be "0001.0010.1111.1111.1111" for this instruction               |
|       7-4    Opcode                                                                |
|               0001b: BX{cond}  Rn    ;PC=Rn, T=Rn.0   (ARMv4T and ARMv5 and up)    |
|               0010b: BXJ{cond} Rn    ;Change to Jazelle bytecode (ARMv5TEJ and up) |
|               0011b: BLX{cond} Rn    ;PC=Rn, T=Rn.0, LR=PC+4     (ARMv5 and up)    |
|       3-0    Rn - Operand Register  (R0-R14)                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Switching to THUMB Mode: Set Bit 0 of the value in Rn to 1, program continues then at Rn-1 in THUMB mode.
Using BLX R14 is possible (sets PC=Old_LR, and New_LR=retadr).
Using BX R15 acts as BX \$+8 (tested and working on ARM7/ARM9, although it isn\'t officially defined as predictable behaviour).
Execution Time: 2S + 1N
Return: No flags affected.

### Notes on BXJ (Branch or change to Jazelle bytecode state):
If Jazelle is suppored/enabled: Executes Java bytecode at address R14
If Jazelle is NOT suppored/enabled: Behaves exactly same as BX Rn
That is, R14 is the byte code address, and Rn is an ARM/THUMB error handler.
Supported on ARMv5TEJ and ARMv6 and up.

### Branch via ALU, LDR, LDM
Most ALU, LDR, LDM opcodes can also change PC/R15.

### Software Interrupt (SWI/BKPT) (svc/abt exceptions)
SWI supposed for calls to the operating system - Enter Supervisor mode (SVC) in ARM state. BKPT intended for debugging - enters Abort mode in ARM state via Prefetch Abort vector.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                     |
|       31-28  Condition (must be 1110b for BKPT, ie. Condition=always)  |
|       27-24  Opcode                                                    |
|               1111b: SWI{cond} nn   ;software interrupt                |
|               0001b: BKPT      nn   ;breakpoint (ARMv5 and up)         |
|       For SWI:                                                         |
|        23-0   nn - Comment Field, ignored by processor (24bit value)   |
|       For BKPT:                                                        |
|        23-20  Must be 0010b for BKPT                                   |
|        19-8   nn - upper 12bits of comment field, ignored by processor |
|        7-4    Must be 0111b for BKPT                                   |
|        3-0    nn - lower 4bits of comment field, ignored by processor  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Execution Time: 2S+1N
The exception handler may interprete the SWI Comment Field by examining the lower 24bit of the 32bit opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-4\]. If your are also using SWI\'s from inside of THUMB, then the SWI handler must examine the T Bit SPSR_svc in order to determine whether it\'s been a THUMB SWI - and if so, examine the lower 8bit of the 16bit opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-2\].
For Returning from SWI use \"MOVS PC,R14\", that instruction does restore both PC and CPSR, ie. PC=R14_svc, and CPSR=SPSR_svc.
Nesting SWIs: SPSR_svc and R14_svc should be saved on stack before either invoking nested SWIs, or (if the IRQ handler uses SWIs) before enabling IRQs.
Execution SWI/BKPT:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       R14_svc=PC+4     R14_abt=PC+4   ;save return address                      |
|       SPSR_svc=CPSR    SPSR_abt=CPSR  ;save CPSR flags                          |
|       CPSR=<changed>   CPSR=<changed> ;Enter svc/abt, ARM state, IRQs disabled  |
|       PC=VVVV0008h     PC=VVVV000Ch   ;jump to SWI/PrefetchAbort vector address |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Undefined Instruction (und exception)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                    |
|       31-28  Condition                                                |
|       27-25  Must be 011b for this instruction                        |
|       24-5   Reserved for future use                                  |
|       4      Must be 1b for this instruction                          |
|       3-0    Reserved for future use                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

No assembler mnemonic exists, following bitstreams are (not) reserved.

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       cond011xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1xxxx - reserved for future use (except below). |
|       cond01111111xxxxxxxxxxxx1111xxxx - free for user.                          |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: ARMv6 does use the \"reserved for future\" space for the new SIMD opcodes (but still has the \"free for user\" space available as \"undefined\").
Execution time: 2S+1I+1N.
