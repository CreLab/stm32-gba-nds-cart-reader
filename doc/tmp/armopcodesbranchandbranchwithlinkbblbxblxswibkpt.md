# ARM Opcodes: Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL, BX, BLX, SWI, BKPT)


**Branch and Branch with Link (B, BL, BLX_imm)**
Branch (B) is supposed to jump to a subroutine. Branch with Link is
meant to be used to call to a subroutine, return address is then saved
in R14.

Branch with Link can be used to \'call\' to a sub-routine, which ma
then \'return\' by MOV PC,R14 for example.
Execution Time: 2S + 1N
Return: No flags affected.

**Branch and Exchange (BX, BLX_reg)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit    Expl.                                                    |
|       31-28  Condition                                                |
|       27-8   Must be "0001.0010.1111.1111.1111" for this instruction  |
|       7-4    Opcode                                                   |
|                                                                       |
|     0001b: BX{cond}  Rn    ;PC=Rn, T=Rn.0   (ARMv4T and ARMv5 and up) |
|                                                                       |
|  0010b: BXJ{cond} Rn    ;Change to Jazelle bytecode (ARMv5TEJ and up) |
|                                                                       |
|     0011b: BLX{cond} Rn    ;PC=Rn, T=Rn.0, LR=PC+4     (ARMv5 and up) |
|       3-0    Rn - Operand Register  (R0-R14)                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Switching to THUMB Mode: Set Bit 0 of the value in Rn to 1, program
continues then at Rn-1 in THUMB mode.
Using BLX R14 is possible (sets PC=Old_LR, and New_LR=retadr).
Using BX R15 acts as BX \$+8 (tested and working on ARM7/ARM9, althoug
it isn\'t officially defined as predictable behaviour).
Execution Time: 2S + 1N
Return: No flags affected.

**Notes on BXJ (Branch or change to Jazelle bytecode state):**
If Jazelle is suppored/enabled: Executes Java bytecode at address R14
If Jazelle is NOT suppored/enabled: Behaves exactly same as BX Rn
That is, R14 is the byte code address, and Rn is an ARM/THUMB error
handler.
Supported on ARMv5TEJ and ARMv6 and up.

**Branch via ALU, LDR, LDM**
Most ALU, LDR, LDM opcodes can also change PC/R15.

**Software Interrupt (SWI/BKPT) (svc/abt exceptions)**
SWI supposed for calls to the operating system - Enter Supervisor mode
(SVC) in ARM state. BKPT intended for debugging - enters Abort mode in
ARM state via Prefetch Abort vector.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Execution Time: 2S+1N
The exception handler may interprete the SWI Comment Field by examining
- the lower 24bit of the 32bit opcode opcode at \[R14_svc-4\]. If your ar
also using SWI\'s from inside of THUMB, then the SWI handler mus
examine the T Bit SPSR_svc in order to determine whether it\'s been 
THUMB SWI - and if so, examine the lower 8bit of the 16bit opcode opcode
- at \[R14_svc-2\].
For Returning from SWI use \"MOVS PC,R14\", that instruction doe
restore both PC and CPSR, ie. PC=R14_svc, and CPSR=SPSR_svc.
Nesting SWIs: SPSR_svc and R14_svc should be saved on stack before
either invoking nested SWIs, or (if the IRQ handler uses SWIs) before
enabling IRQs.
Execution SWI/BKPT:

| R=<changed>   CPSR=<changed> ;Enter svc/abt, ARM state, IRQs disabled |

No assembler mnemonic exists, following bitstreams are (not) reserved.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       cond0                                                           |
| 11xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx1xxxx - reserved for future use (except below). |
|       cond01111111xxxxxxxxxxxx1111xxxx - free for user.               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: ARMv6 does use the \"reserved for future\" space for the new SIM
opcodes (but still has the \"free for user\" space available a
\"undefined\").
