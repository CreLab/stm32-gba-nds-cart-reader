# 3DS Files - Video Banner (Extended Banner)


**Overview**
The Extended Banner is used to add text (and optionally an extra
texture) to a given banner. It can also (optionally) be used to set an
expiration date for a banner.

See \"\\user\\ExBanner\\\" for how the extended-banners are loaded fro
extdata. The Home Menu extended-banner loading function will immediately
return without loading anything if the programID is for System
Settings.

The date used for never-expiring exbanners varies, on retail like with
Mii Maker this is 31 Dec 2099 (year=833h, month=0Ch, day=1Fh). The
expiration-timestamp is only used for SpotPass exbanners, not
extdata-exbanners.

**SpotPass**
When Home Menu loads extended-banners, it also attempts to load a
\"CBMD\" banner via SpotPass service commands. Normally this CBMD banne
doesn\'t exist in extended-banner extdata. This is broken with New3D
titles since Home Menu uses these BOSS commands with the New3DS bitmask
in the programID set. The common and language-specific (when offset is
non-zero) \"CGFX\" specified by the CBMD are decompressed an
processed.

The \"CGFX\" sections in this CBMD are actually the exact same exbanner
loaded from normal extdata. The exbanner data from SpotPass is stored to
the same state as the extdata-exbanners. No CWAV is loaded from SpotPass
data.

The exbanners from SpotPass must have a timestamp less than
current_datetime, otherwise they won\'t be parsed. The timestamp for th
banner is calculated with: nintimestamp_mktime(out, exbanner-\>year
exbanner-\>month, exbanner-\>day, \<hour=23\>, \<minute = 59\>, \<secon
= 59\>, \<millisecond = 999\>);
