### Multiply and Multiply-Accumulate (MUL, MLA)
Restrictions: Rd may not be same as Rm. Rd,Rn,Rs,Rm may not be R15.
Note: Only the lower 32bit of the internal 64bit result are stored in Rd, thus no sign/zero extension is required and MUL and MLA can be used for both signed and unsigned calculations!
Execution Time: 1S+mI for MUL, and 1S+(m+1)I for MLA. Whereas \'m\' depends on whether/how many most significant bits of Rs are all zero or all one. That is m=1 for Bit 31-8, m=2 for Bit 31-16, m=3 for Bit 31-24, and m=4 otherwise.
Flags (if S=1): Z=zeroflag, N=signflag, C=destroyed (ARMv4 and below) or C=not affected (ARMv5 and up), V=not affected. MUL/MLA supported by ARMv2 and up.

### Multiply Long and Multiply-Accumulate Long (MULL, MLAL)
Optionally supported, INCLUDED in ARMv3M, EXCLUDED in ARMv4xM/ARMv5xM.
Restrictions: RdHi,RdLo,Rm must be different registers. R15 may not be used.
Execution Time: 1S+(m+1)I for MULL, and 1S+(m+2)I for MLAL. Whereas \'m\' depends on whether/how many most significant bits of Rs are \"all zero\" (UMULL/UMLAL) or \"all zero or all one\" (SMULL,SMLAL). That is m=1 for Bit31-8, m=2 for Bit31-16, m=3 for Bit31-24, and m=4 otherwise.
Flags (if S=1): Z=zeroflag, N=signflag, C=destroyed (ARMv4 and below) or C=not affected (ARMv5 and up), V=destroyed??? (ARMv4 and below???) or V=not affected (ARMv5 and up).

### Signed Halfword Multiply (SMLAxy,SMLAWy,SMLALxy,SMULxy,SMULWy)
Supported by E variants of ARMv5 and up, ie. ARMv5TE(xP).
Q-flag gets set on 32bit SMLAxy/SMLAWy addition overflows, however, the result is NOT truncated (as it\'d be done with QADD opcodes).
Q-flag is NOT affected on (rare) 64bit SMLALxy addition overflows.
SMULxy/SMULWy cannot overflow, and thus leave Q-flag unchanged as well.
NZCV-flags are not affected by Halfword multiplies.
Execution Time: 1S+Interlock (SMULxy,SMLAxy,SMULWx,SMLAWx)
Execution Time: 1S+1I+Interlock (SMLALxy)

### Unsigned Multiply Accumulate Accumulate Long (UMAAL)
Multiply with two 32bit additions, supposed to be used for cryptography.
Flags are not affected.
ARMv6 and above.
