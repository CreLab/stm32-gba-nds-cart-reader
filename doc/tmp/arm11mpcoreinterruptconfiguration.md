# ARM11 MPCore - Interrupt Configuration


**Distributed Interrupt Controller (for Interrupt Configuration)**
These registers are mostly used for interrupt configuration (and for
internally maintaining an list of pending/active interrupts).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       -- Most of these registers exists only once (not per CPU) --    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Except, the Priority for Software Interrupts 00h-0Fh can be configured
per LOCAL CPU. And, the Pending and Active flags do \<internally\> exis
for each CPU (for Software Interrupts 00h-0Fh, they do even exists for
\"From each CPU to each CPU\"). However, reading th
Pending/Active/Priority flags doesn\'t fully represent all of th
internal per-CPU states.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If bit0=0, no interrupts at all are sent to the CPU interrupt
interfaces.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: Interrupt ID 00h-1Fh are internal IRQs, ID 20h-FFh are external
IRQs.
On Old3DS this 00000023h, 2 CPUs and 80h IRQs.
On New3DS this 00000063h, 4 CPUs and 80h IRQs (even in Old3DS mode).

|  Interrupt 10h-FFh (Read: 0=Disabled, 1=Enabled) (Write: 1=Set/Clear) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Enable means that pending IRQs will be transmitted to the targeted
CPUs.
The enable bit, when set to 0, does not prevent an edge-triggered
interrupt from becoming Pending.
The enable bit, when set to 0, does prevent a level sensitive interrupt
from becoming Pending only if asserted by the hardware pin, INT.
Note: If an interrupt is Pending or Active when its enable bit is set to
0, it remains in its current state.

**17E01300h..17E0131Fh - Active Bit Registers (256 x 1bit) (R)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-                                                              |

| -255 Interrupt 20h-FFh is active on one or more CPUs (0=No, 1=Active) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Active means that the interrupt is being processed on at least one MP11
CPU.

**17E01400h..17E014FFh - Interrupt Priority Registers (256 x 8bit)
(R/W)**
The priority determines which interrupt will show up next in the
interrupt interface registers. And, the interface registers can be used
to manually disable lower priority interrupts during \'critica
sections\'. And, while processing an interrupt, the hardware wil
automatically disable interrupts with same or lower priority
(optionally, the \"Binary Point\" feature allows to ignore the LSBs o
the priorioty, eg. ignoring the lowest bit with allow to also disable
interrupts with slightly higher priority).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-127                                                           |
|    Interrupt 00h-0Fh Priority for local CPU (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio) |

| 8-231   Interrupt 10h-1Ch Priority for nothing?  (bit0-7=Unused/zero) |
|       232-255                                                         |
|    Interrupt 1Dh-1Fh Priority for local CPU (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio) |
|       256-204                                                         |
| 7  Interrupt 20h-FFh Priority for all CPUs  (bit0-3=SBZ, bit4-7=Prio) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Priority values are 00h=Highest\... E0h=Lowest, or F0h=None (same a
interrupt disabled).
When multiple Pending interrupts have the same priority, the selected
interrupt is the one with lowest ID. If there are multiple Pending
software interrupts with the same ID, the lowest MP11 CPU source is
selected.

**17E01800h..17E018FFh - Interrupt CPU Targets Registers (256 x 8bit)
(R/W)**
These registers store the list of MP11 CPUs for which an interrupt can
be Pending. Interrupt target registers are ignored in cases of software
triggered interrupts.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-231                                                           |
|     Interrupt 00h-1Ch Target (fixed 00h) (see 17E01F00h instead)  (-) |
|       232-25                                                          |
| 5   Interrupt 1Dh-1Fh Target (fixed 01h/02h/04h/08h for CPU0..3)  (R) |
|       256-20                                                          |
| 47  Interrupt 20h-FFh Target (bit0-3=CPU0..3, bit4-7=SBZ)       (R/W) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Modifying a CPU target list has no influence on a Pending or Active
interrupt, but takes effect on a subsequent assertion of the interrupt.

**17E01C00h..17E01C3Fh - Interrupt Configuration Registers (256 x 2bit)
(R/W)**
Interrupt Configuration Registers define the assertion condition and the
software model of each interrupt.

|       01h = 1-N software model, level high active                     |
|       02h = N-N software model, rising edge sensitive                 |

The N-N and 1-N models are relevant only if more than one CPU is
configured as Target:

```

| eared only for the CPU that takes it, not for the other CPUs. The N-N |
|         model                                                         |
|  has been deprecated in the latest interrupt controller architecture. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unknown how 1-N and N-N differ for Interrupt 00h-0Fh (it\'s said tha
each CPU has it\'s own pending flags for 00h-0Fh, so the model should b
always \"1-1\").
