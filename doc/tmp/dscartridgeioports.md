# DS Cartridge I/O Ports


The Gamecard bus registers can be mapped to NDS7 or NDS9 via EXMEMCNT,
see

**40001A0h - NDS7/NDS9 - AUXSPICNT - Gamecard ROM and SPI Control
(R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|  0-1   SPI Baudrate        (0=4MHz/Default, 1=2MHz, 2=1MHz, 3=512KHz) |
|       2-5   Not used            (always zero)                         |
|       6                                                               |
|      SPI Hold Chipselect (0=Deselect after transfer, 1=Keep selected) |
|                                                                       |
|    7     SPI Busy            (0=Ready, 1=Busy) (presumably Read-only) |
|       8-12  Not used            (always zero)                         |
|       13    NDS Slot Mode       (0=Parallel/ROM, 1=Serial/SPI-Backup) |
|       14                                                              |
|   Transfer Ready IRQ  (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (for ROM, not for AUXSPI) |
|       15                                                              |
|   NDS Slot Enable     (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (for both ROM and AUXSPI) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The \"Hold\" flag should be cleared BEFORE transferring the LAST dat
unit, the chipselect will be then automatically cleared after the
transfer, the program should issue a WaitByLoop(12) on NDS7 (or longer
on NDS9) manually AFTER the LAST transfer.

**40001A2h - NDS7/NDS9 - AUXSPIDATA - Gamecard SPI Bus Data/Strobe
(R/W)**
The SPI transfer is started on writing to this register, so one must
\<write\> a dummy value (should be zero) even when intending to \<read\
from SPI bus.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7  Data                                                       |
|       8-15 Not used (always zero)                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

During transfer, the Busy flag in AUXSPICNT is set, and the written DATA
value is transferred to the device (via output line), simultaneously
data is received (via input line). Upon transfer completion, the Busy
flag goes off, and the received value can be then read from AUXSPIDATA,
if desired.

```

The cartridge header is booted at 4.2MHz CLK rate, and following
transfers are then using ROMCTRL settings specified in cartridge header
- entries \[060h\] and \[064h\], which are usually using 6.7MHz CLK rat
for the main data transfer phase (whereof, older MROM carts can actually
transfer 6.7Mbyte/s, but newer 1T-ROM carts default to reading 200h-byte
blocks with gap1=657h, thus reaching only 1.6Mbyte/s).
Transfer length of null, four, and 200h..4000h bytes are supported by
the console, however, retail cartridges cannot cross 1000h-byte
boundaries (and, SanDisk ROM chips and Samsung NAND chips cannot
transfer more than 200h bytes).
**Default cart header entries**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       hdr[60h]   hdr[64h]   hdr[6Eh]                                  |
|       00586000h  001808F8h  051Eh     ;older/faster MROM              |
|       00416657h  081808F8h  0D7Eh     ;newer/slower 1T-ROM            |
|       00416657h  081808F8h  0D7Eh     ;newer/slower NAND              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Older/Faster MROM**
- The romctrl values in cartheader\[60h,64h\] are okay, but the secur
- delay in \[6Eh\] is nonsense (should be zero).
**Misdeclared MROM**
Some carts like SystemFlaw and BiggestLoser are actually containing MROM
chips despite of having 1T-ROM values in cart header (gap1=657h is
making loading insane slow, gap2=01h causes errors on 1000h-byte blocks,
and secure.clk=4.2MHz is slowing down secure area loading, combined with
even slower secure area delay despite of not needing any delay for
MROM).
As the cart header entries are wrong, some other detection is needed:
This can be probably done by checking ChipID.bit31 (or otherwise by
testing if 1000h-block reading works with gap1=01h, if so, then it\'
1T-ROM).
**Newer/Slower 1T-ROM**
Actual 1T-ROM carts can be very slow, especially when using the insane
cart header values and default firmware blocksize of 200h bytes which
drops loading speed from 6.7Mbytes/s to 1.6Mbyte/s (as workaround, use
gap1=180h, blocksize=1000h, also secure area delay should be 400h, not
D7Eh) (tested/working for CookingCoach, unknown if that timings work for
all other carts).
**Superslow Writeable NAND**
This is having the same official insane delays as 1T-ROM, but with less
tolerance for faster timings (fastest working values are gap1=380h,
blocksize=200h, secure delay 400h, plus 20ms delay after releasing
reset).
**Cart Reset**
Reset flag in bit29 can be set once only (to release reset), the only
way to clear the bit is power-off. However, there are some ways to issue
resets:
1) On NDS: Manually eject/insert the cart (that won\'t affect bit29, bu
the cart will reset itself anyways upon power loss) (eject on DSi will
power-off the cart slot).
2) If one of the two ROMCTRL registers (on ARM7 and ARM9) is still zero:
Temporarily toggle ARM7/ARM9 cart access via EXMEMCNT on ARM9 side.
3) On DSi: If the 2nd cart slot ROMCTRL register (40021A4h) is still
zero: Temporarily swap 1ns/2nd cart slot via SCFG_MC.bit15 on ARM7
side.
4) On DSi: Use SCFG_MC to toggle cart power off/on; this will actually
reset bit29, the DSi firmware is actually using that method, but it\'
very slow (takes about 300ms, for the power-off wait, plus
(unneccassary) hardcoded power-on delays).

**40001A8h - NDS7/NDS9 - Gamecard bus 8-byte Command Out**
The separate commands are described in the Cartridge Protocol chapter,
however, once when the BIOS boot procedure has completed, one would
usually only need command \"B7aaaaaaaa000000h\", for reading dat
(usually 200h bytes) from address aaaaaaaah (which should be usually
aligned by 200h).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   1st Command Byte (at 40001A8h) (eg. B7h) (MSB)            |
|       8-15  2nd Command Byte (at 40001A9h) (eg. addr bit 24-31)       |
|       16-23 3rd Command Byte (at 40001AAh) (eg. addr bit 16-23)       |
|       24-31 4                                                         |
| th Command Byte (at 40001ABh) (eg. addr bit 8-15) (when aligned=even) |
|       32-39                                                           |
| 5th Command Byte (at 40001ACh) (eg. addr bit 0-7)  (when aligned=00h) |
|       40-47 6th Command Byte (at 40001ADh) (eg. 00h)                  |
|       48-57 7th Command Byte (at 40001AEh) (eg. 00h)                  |
|       56-63 8th Command Byte (at 40001AFh) (eg. 00h) (LSB)            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Observe that the command/parameter MSB is located at the smallest memory
location (40001A8h), ie. compared with the CPU, the byte-order is
reversed.

**4100010h - NDS7/NDS9 - Gamecard bus 4-byte Data In (R) (or W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   1st received Data Byte (at 4100010h)                      |
|       8-15  2nd received Data Byte (at 4100011h)                      |
|       16-23 3rd received Data Byte (at 4100012h)                      |
|       24-31 4th received Data Byte (at 4100013h)                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

After sending a command, data can be read from this register manually
(when the DRQ bit is set), or by DMA (with DMASAD=4100010h, Fixed Source
Address, Length=1, Size=32bit, Repeat=On, Mode=DS Gamecard).

**40001B0h - 32bit - NDS7/NDS9 - Encryption Seed 0 Lower 32bit (W)**
**40001B4h - 32bit - NDS7/NDS9 - Encryption Seed 1 Lower 32bit (W)**
**40001B8h - 16bit - NDS7/NDS9 - Encryption Seed 0 Upper 7bit (bit7-15
unused)**
**40001BAh - 16bit - NDS7/NDS9 - Encryption Seed 1 Upper 7bit (bit7-15
unused)**
These registers are used by the NDS7 BIOS to initialize KEY2 encryption
(and there\'s normally no need to change that initial settings). Write
to the Seed registers do not have direct effect on the internal
encryption registers, until the Seed gets applied by writing \"1\" t
ROMCTRL.Bit15.

- [DS Encryption by Random Seed (./dsencryptionbyrandomseedkey2.md)
Note: There are \<separate\> Seed registers for both NDS7 and NDS9
which can be applied by ROMCTRL on NDS7 and NDS9 respectively (however,
once when applied to the internal registers, the new internal setting is
used for \<both\> CPUs).
