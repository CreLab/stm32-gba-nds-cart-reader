# GBA Cart e-Reader Overview


The e-Reader is a large GBA cartridge (about as big as the GBA console), with built-in dotcode scanning hardware. Dotcodes are tiny strips of black and white pixels printed on the edges of cardboard cards. The cards have to be pulled through a slot on the e-Reader, which is giving it a feeling like using a magnet card reader. The binary data on the dotcodes contains small games, either in native GBA code (ARM/THUMB), or in software emulated 8bit Z80 or NES/Famicom (6502) code.

### The e-Reader Hardware
The hardware consists of regular 8MByte ROM and 128KByte FLASH chips, two link ports, a custom PGA chip, the camera module (with two red LEDs, used as light source), and some analogue components for generating the LED voltages, etc. The camera supports 402x302 pixels with 7bit monochrome color depth, but the PGA clips it to max 320 pixels per scanline with 1bit color depth.

### Link Port Plug/Socket
The e-Reader\'s two link ports are simply interconnected with each other; without connection to the rest of the e-Reader hardware. These ports are used only on the original GBA (where the large e-Reader cartridge would be covering the GBA\'s link socket). When trying to insert the e-Reader into an original NDS (or GBA-Micro), then the e-Reader\'s link plug will hit against the case of the NDS, so it works only with some minor modification to the hardware. There\'s no such problem with GBA-SP and NDS-Lite.

### Region/Version
There are 3 different e-Reader\'s: Japanese/Original, Japanese/Plus, and Non-Japanese. The Original version has only 64K FLASH, no Link Port, and reportedly supports only Z80 code, but no NES/GBA code. The Plus and Non-Japanese versions should be almost identical, except that they reject cards from the wrong region, and that the title strings aren\'t ASCII in Japan, the Plus version should be backwards compatible to the Original one.

### The Problem
Nintendo\'s current programmers are definetly unable to squeeze a Pac-Man style game into less than 4MBytes. Their solution has been: MORE memory. That is, they\'ve put a whopping 8MByte BIOS ROM into the e-Reader, which contains the User Interface, and software emulation for running some of their 20 years old 8bit NES and Game&Watch titles, which do fit on a few dotcode strips.
