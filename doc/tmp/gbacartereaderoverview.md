# GBA Cart e-Reader Overview


The e-Reader is a large GBA cartridge (about as big as the GBA console),
with built-in dotcode scanning hardware. Dotcodes are tiny strips of
black and white pixels printed on the edges of cardboard cards. The
cards have to be pulled through a slot on the e-Reader, which is giving
it a feeling like using a magnet card reader. The binary data on the
dotcodes contains small games, either in native GBA code (ARM/THUMB), or
in software emulated 8bit Z80 or NES/Famicom (6502) code.

**The e-Reader Hardware**
The hardware consists of regular 8MByte ROM and 128KByte FLASH chips,
two link ports, a custom PGA chip, the camera module (with two red LEDs,
used as light source), and some analogue components for generating the
LED voltages, etc. The camera supports 402x302 pixels with 7bit
monochrome color depth, but the PGA clips it to max 320 pixels per
scanline with 1bit color depth.

**Link Port Plug/Socket**
The e-Reader\'s two link ports are simply interconnected with eac
other; without connection to the rest of the e-Reader hardware. These
ports are used only on the original GBA (where the large e-Reader
cartridge would be covering the GBA\'s link socket). When trying t
insert the e-Reader into an original NDS (or GBA-Micro), then the
e-Reader\'s link plug will hit against the case of the NDS, so it work
only with some minor modification to the hardware. There\'s no suc
problem with GBA-SP and NDS-Lite.

**Region/Version**
There are 3 different e-Reader\'s: Japanese/Original, Japanese/Plus, an
Non-Japanese. The Original version has only 64K FLASH, no Link Port, and
reportedly supports only Z80 code, but no NES/GBA code. The Plus and
Non-Japanese versions should be almost identical, except that they
reject cards from the wrong region, and that the title strings aren\'
ASCII in Japan, the Plus version should be backwards compatible to the
Original one.

**The Problem**
Nintendo\'s current programmers are definetly unable to squeeze 
Pac-Man style game into less than 4MBytes. Their solution has been: MORE
memory. That is, they\'ve put a whopping 8MByte BIOS ROM into th
e-Reader, which contains the User Interface, and software emulation for
running some of their 20 years old 8bit NES and Game&Watch titles, which
do fit on a few dotcode strips.
