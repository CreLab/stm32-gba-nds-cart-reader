# DSi I2C Device 4Ah (BPTWL chip)


I2C Bus Caution: The BPTWL chip requires swiWaitByLoop(180h) after each
- I2C byte transfer (if the Version/Speed byte at BPTWL\[00h\] indicate
\"Fast\", then the delay can be reduced to 90h instead of 180h).
And, SPI bus Powerman chip does somehow interact with I2C BPTWL chip;
there must be a similar delay between Powerman writes and BPTWL writes.

```

The R/W values can be set to 00h..FFh (except Index 40h/41h are quickly
cropped to max 1Fh/04h, and Index 70h/71h are (after some time) cropped
to 01h/02h).
Above should probably also include:

```

| Forced volume (for alerts) (ie. alternately to current "user volume") |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**BPTWL Emulation on 3DS**
The 3DS MCU emulates the BPTWL chip for DSi mode (and the emulated
registers can be also accessed in 3DS mode). The emulation supports only
a few of the original BPTWL registers & bits though:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h     R   Version/Speed (35h on New3DS)                       |
|                                                                       |
| 10h     R   Power Button Status (only 2 bits?: bit3=WasDown?, bit6=?) |
|       11h     R/W Reset (01h=Reset, other=ignored) (read: always 00h) |
|       12h     R/W Power Button Tapping (bit0,1,7=?)                   |
|       20h     R   Battery State                                       |
|       31h     R/W Camera LED (bit0,1)                                 |
|       40h     R/W Volume Level                                        |
|       70h     R/W Bootflag                                            |
|       Other   -   Unused (FFh)                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**DSi Power Button**
Logically, the Power Button has two functions:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Shor                                                            |
| t tap --> reset (warmboot, go to DSi menu, without health and safety) |
|       Hold 1 second --> power-off                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Technically, the button can have three functions:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Auto-Reset (used for NDS games)                                 |
|                                                                       |
|      IRQ (supposed to be used with Manual-Reset) (used for DSi games) |
|       Force                                                           |
| d Power-off (for games which fail to handle the IRQ within 5 seconds) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

DSi games should handle the IRQ as follows: First, do some clean up
(like finishing writes to SD/MMC storage; to avoid FAT corruption).
Then, issue a Reset manually (via I2C/BPTWL registers
- \[70h\]=01h/Warmboot, \[11h\]=01h/Reset).
Power-Off can be implemented via SPI/Power Managment Device, however,
games only need to implement Manual-Reset or Auto-Reset, but don\'t nee
to implement Power-Off (the firmware will do that automatically if the
button is held down for 1 second after issuing the Reset).
Ideally, emulators should also reproduce the power button (when
resetting or closing the emulator): Signalize power-button and keep the
emulation running until the game responds by Reset (or until five second
timeout). That will allow the game to finish writes to emulated SD/MMC
storage.

**DSi Autostart on Warmboot (20h-byte area) (also requires
- BPTWL\[70h\]=01h)**
The DSi can be commanded to load a different title (eg. System
Settings), instead of showing the Boot Menu after warmboot.

**Inner workings**
The DSi\'s BPTWL chip contains a 78K/0 microprocessor. The BPTW
firmware has aparently leaked in a \"TWL_MCU_33-MP_95811supp.hex\" file
There is also a \"UTL_MCU_BA.hex\" file (for DSi XL?).
- [78K/0 Opcode List](./78k0opcodelist.md)
- [78K/0 Opcode Map](./78k0opcodemap.md)
- [78K/0 Memory Map and SFRs](./78k0memorymapandsfrs.md)
Programming via external serial cable is about same as on 3DS:
- [3DS I2C MCU - RL78 Flash Programming viaUART](./3dsi2cmcurl78flashprogrammingviauart.md)
The 3DS\' MCU emulates the BPTWL functions by using a 78K0R
microprocessor (with similar asm syntax, but completely different opcode
numbering, with more 16bit ALU opcodes, new conditional-skip opcodes,
and 20bit addressing).
