The \"Next Photo/Frame\" entries contain File/Folder Numbers where th
next images will be saved; that file numbers increase after saving, and
do eventually wrap to next higher folder number.
The Nintendo DSi Camera utility shows only photos listed in \"pit.bin\"
when manually copying jpg\'s to SD Card one could:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - Delete                                                         |
|  "pit.bin" (it'll be recreated with ALL jpgs, sticker flags are lost) |
|                                                                       |
|  - Replace an existing 'listed' file by a new file with same filename |
|      - Manually edit "pit.bin" and adjust its CRC16 checksum          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Photos are region free, can be viewed from any other DSi\'s (as long a
they are listed in pit.bin). However, they do require some signature in
Exif header, so in general, the DSi accepts only images that come from
DSi consoles; not images from other sources.

**Stickers**
Photos with \"Star\" sticker are shown as background picture in Syste
Menu; this works only for images stored in internal eMMC memory (images
on SD Card can have stickers, too, but they are ignored by System
Menu).
