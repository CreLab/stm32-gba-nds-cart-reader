# SIO UART Mode


This mode works much like a RS232 port, however, the voltages are
unknown, probably 0/3V rather than +/-12V ?. SI and SO are data lines
(with crossed wires), SC and SD signalize Clear to Send (with crossed
wires also, which requires special cable when linking between two GBAs
?)

**400012Ah - SIODATA8 - usage in UART Mode (R/W)**
Addresses the send/receive shift register, or (when FIFO is used) the
send/receive FIFO. In either case only the lower 8bit of SIODATA8 are
used, the upper 8bit are not used.
The send/receive FIFO may store up to four 8bit data units each. For
example, while 1 unit is still transferred from the send shift register,
it is possible to deposit another 4 units in the send FIFO, which are
then automatically moved to the send shift register one after each
other.

**Send/Receive Enable, CTS Feedback**
The receiver outputs SD=LOW (which is input as SC=LOW at the remote
side) when it is ready to receive data (that is, when Receive Enable is
set, and the Receive shift register (or receive FIFO) isn\'t full.
When CTS flag is set to always/blindly, then the sender transmits data
immediately when Send Enable is set, otherwise data is transmitted only
when Send Enable is set and SC is LOW.

**Error Flag**
The error flag is set when a bad stop bit has been received (stop bit
must be 0), when a parity error has occurred (if enabled), or when new
data has been completely received while the receive data register (or
receive FIFO) is already full.
The error flag is automatically reset when reading from SIOCNT
register.

**Init & Initback**
The content of the FIFO is reset when FIFO is disabled in UART mode,
thus, when entering UART mode initially set FIFO=disabled.
The Send/Receive enable bits must be reset before switching from UART
mode into another SIO mode!
