**Normal CGB Boot**
The GBA does always boot in GBA mode, but the GBA BIOS does almost
immediately switch to CGB mode when detecting gameboy cart via Port
4000204h; that detection relies on a mechanical switch in the cartridge
slot, which does also toggle the system voltage from 3.3V (GBA) to 5V
(CGB).

**GBA, GBA SP, and GBA micro**
CGB mode is supported on GBA and GBA SP. The GBA micro does lack the
cartridge switch (and thus cannot detect 8bit carts, and cannot switch
the system voltage, nethertheless it does contain semi-functional CGB
hardware: it can be manually switched to CGB mode and execute the CGB
intro).

**CGB Bootrom Disable**
The CGB Bootrom can be disabled via 4000800h, that allows to skip the
CGB intro (but requires booting custom GBA code with GBA intro and then
hot plugging a gameboy cartridge, which must contain a valid entrypoint
at address 0000h, and which must select CGB or DMG mode and initialize
the DMG color scheme).
The Bootrom Disable works same as ROMDIS pin on real CGBs (and also
includes unlocking port FF60h, FF61h, FF63h, see no\$gmb/pandocs fo
details).
Unknown if it\'s possible to keep the ARM CPU running after entering CG
mode (so one could re-disable ROMDIS some cycles after booting).

**Palette Issues**
The GBA vs CGB palettes have different intensities ramps (CGB colors
with medium brightness will appear black on GBA), that\'s making CG
games mostly unplayable on GBA (and only monochrome DMG games are
actually working on GBA). As a workaroud, one could tweak BLDCNT/BLDY to
increase the brightness.
