### Normal CGB Boot
The GBA does always boot in GBA mode, but the GBA BIOS does almost immediately switch to CGB mode when detecting gameboy cart via Port 4000204h; that detection relies on a mechanical switch in the cartridge slot, which does also toggle the system voltage from 3.3V (GBA) to 5V (CGB).

### GBA, GBA SP, and GBA micro
CGB mode is supported on GBA and GBA SP. The GBA micro does lack the cartridge switch (and thus cannot detect 8bit carts, and cannot switch the system voltage, nethertheless it does contain semi-functional CGB hardware: it can be manually switched to CGB mode and execute the CGB intro).

### CGB Bootrom Disable
The CGB Bootrom can be disabled via 4000800h, that allows to skip the CGB intro (but requires booting custom GBA code with GBA intro and then hot plugging a gameboy cartridge, which must contain a valid entrypoint at address 0000h, and which must select CGB or DMG mode and initialize the DMG color scheme).
The Bootrom Disable works same as ROMDIS pin on real CGBs (and also includes unlocking port FF60h, FF61h, FF63h, see no\$gmb/pandocs for details).
Unknown if it\'s possible to keep the ARM CPU running after entering CGB mode (so one could re-disable ROMDIS some cycles after booting).

### Palette Issues
The GBA vs CGB palettes have different intensities ramps (CGB colors with medium brightness will appear black on GBA), that\'s making CGB games mostly unplayable on GBA (and only monochrome DMG games are actually working on GBA). As a workaroud, one could tweak BLDCNT/BLDY to increase the brightness.
