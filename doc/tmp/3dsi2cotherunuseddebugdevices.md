# 3DS I2C Other/Unused/Debug Devices


**Device 7 (Bus/device 1:40h) \"i2c::DEB\" Debug?**
**Device 8 (Bus/device 1:44h) \"i2c::DEB\" Debug?**
Unknown.

**Device 9 (Bus/device 2:A6h/D6h) \"i2c::HID\" Debug??**
Unknown.
Device Address changed from A6h to D6h in 8.0.0-18.

**Device 12 (Bus/device 2:A4h) \"DebugPad\"**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Register   Width   Description                                  |
|       00h        21      DebugPad state.                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The DebugPad is reportedly a slightly modified \"Wii Classic Controlle
Pro\" (with type F0h instead of FDh).

**Device 14 (Bus/device 2:A0h) \"eeprom?\"**
Used by Cfg-sysmodule via the i2c::EEP service. This is presumably
EEPROM going by the service name.
The Cfg-module code which loads the CCAL
(nandro:/sys/{HWCAL0.dat/HWCAL1.dat}) file from NAND will load it from
I2C instead, if a certain state flag is non-zero. Likewise for the
function which writes CCAL to NAND. HMAC/hash verification after loading
is skipped when the CCAL was loaded from I2C.

**Bus/device 0:00h-0Eh - Mirrors to BPTWL for whatever reason**
**Bus/device 0:F0h-FEh - Mirrors to BPTWL for whatever reason**
These are special broadcast/reserved device ids (defined in I2C
protocol). The MCU chip apparently includes a hardware feature for
decoding these IDs; and accidentally mirrors the BPTWL registers to
them.

**Bus/device 2:00h - Unknown, something responds here with ACK and
FFh\'s**
This is a special broadcast address (defined in I2C protocol). One (or
more) of the devices on I2C Bus 2 do apparently respond to it\... an
perhaps even support some broadcast commands?
