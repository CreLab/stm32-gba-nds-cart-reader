# 3DS Console IDs


**Hardware IDs**
The main Console ID is stored in OTP memory:
- [3DS Crypto - PRNG and OTP Registers](./3dscryptoprngandotpregisters.md)
The eMMC CID is used for generating console specific encryption keys.
The SD card CID is also used for generating a SD card specific \<ID1\
folder name.

- |    AES-MAC (NAND dbs keyslot) across SHA256 across bytes [000h..12Fh] |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- Bytes \[110h..11Fh\] are used as KeyY for AES keyslots 30h, 34h, an
3Ah:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Keysl                                                           |

|       Keyslot 34h  AES encryption in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\                
|       Keyslot 3Ah  AES-CMACs for DSiWare in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\         
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- Bytes \[110h..11Fh\] are also used to derive the \<ID0\> folder nam
(see below).
Movable.sed is transferred to the destination 3DS during a System
Transfer. The movable.sed keyY high u64 is updated on the source 3DS
during a System Transfer, and when doing a system format with System
Settings.

**3ds:\\data\\\<ID0\>\\ (\<ID0\> folder on 3DS partition)**
**sd:\\Nintendo 3DS\\\<ID0\>\\\<ID1\>\\ (\<ID0\>\\\<ID1\> folder on S
card)**
The \<ID0\> folder name is derived by computing the SHA256 acros
- moveable.sed bytes \[110h..11Fh\], and then converting the first 4 word
of the SHA256 into a lowercase ASCII string (with the byte order
reversed in each of the four words, and with the last 4 words left
unused).
The \<ID1\> folder name is derived by swapping around the byte order o
the SD card CID: The CID is rotated 8-bits to the left (uh, that means
the ending 00h padding byte is moved to begin?). Then, the word-order is
reversed. And then, the halfwords are converted into ascii string (with
byte-order for each byte-pair reversed), or so?

**3ds:\\rw\\sys\\SecureInfo_A (111h bytes) (Region an
Serial/Barcode)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 100h  RSA-2048 signature across following 11h-bytes        |
|       100                                                             |

|  0Fh   Serial/Barcode, without ending check digit (ASCII, zeropadded) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The serial/barcode consists of 2-3 letters, followed by 8 digits,
followed by a checksum digit.
The first letter indicates the console model:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3DS             C  (or E for devunits)                          |
|       3DS XL/LL       S  (or R for devunits)                          |
|       2DS             A  (or P for devunits)                          |
|       New 3DS         Y  (or Yxx00 for devunits)                      |
|       New 3DS XL/LL   Q  (or Qxx00 for devunits)                      |
|       New 2DS XL/LL   N  (or Nxx01 for devunits)                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The next 1-2 letter(s) indicate the region:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       JPN Japan                          JF,JH,JM                     |

|       USA Middle East, Southeast Asia    S                            |
|       EUR Europe                         EF,EH,EM                     |
|       EUR Australia                      AG,AH                        |
|       CHN China (iQue)                   CF,CH,CM                     |
|       KOR South Korea                    KF,KH,KM                     |
|       TWN Taiwan                         ...unknown?                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The checksum digit is found on the consoles barcode sticker, but isn\'
included in the SecureInfo_A file. However, the checksum can be
calculated across 1st-8th digit (and ignoring the leading letters):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       9th = (250 - (1st+3rd+5th+7th) - 3*(2nd+4th+6th+8th)) mod 10    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The RSA private key for retail is unknown. The private key for devkits
is included in the devkit system updater package.
