# 3DS Console IDs


### Hardware IDs
The main Console ID is stored in OTP memory:
- [3DS Crypto - PRNG and OTP Registers](./3dscryptoprngandotpregisters.md)
The eMMC CID is used for generating console specific encryption keys. The SD card CID is also used for generating a SD card specific \<ID1\> folder name.

### 3ds:\\rw\\sys\\LocalFriendCodeSeed_B (or Seed_A, if it exists) (110h bytes)

This can be also retrieved via \"PSPXI:GetLocalFriendCodeSeed\".

### 3ds:\\private\\movable.sed (120h or 140h bytes)

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 4     ID "SEED"                                                          |
|       004h 1     Zero                                                               |
|       005h 1     Zero (or 01h if extra bytes at [120h..13Fh] are appended)          |

|      The original movable.sed from the factory is only 120h-bytes.                  |
|      Below extra data is written to the file when doing a System Format.            |
|       120h 4     Offset (added to above Decrypted OTP[10h..13h] entry)              |
|       124h 0Ch   Zero                                                               |
|       130h 10h   AES-MAC (NAND dbs keyslot) across SHA256 across bytes [000h..12Fh] |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bytes \[110h..11Fh\] are used as KeyY for AES keyslots 30h, 34h, and 3Ah:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Keyslot 30h  AES-CMACs for non-DSiWare in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\ and 3ds:\data\ 
|       Keyslot 34h  AES encryption in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\                           
|       Keyslot 3Ah  AES-CMACs for DSiWare in sd:\Nintendo 3DS\                    
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bytes \[110h..11Fh\] are also used to derive the \<ID0\> folder name (see below).
Movable.sed is transferred to the destination 3DS during a System Transfer. The movable.sed keyY high u64 is updated on the source 3DS during a System Transfer, and when doing a system format with System Settings.

### 3ds:\\data\\\<ID0\>\\ (\<ID0\> folder on 3DS partition)
### sd:\\Nintendo 3DS\\\<ID0\>\\\<ID1\>\\ (\<ID0\>\\\<ID1\> folder on SD card)
The \<ID0\> folder name is derived by computing the SHA256 across moveable.sed bytes \[110h..11Fh\], and then converting the first 4 words of the SHA256 into a lowercase ASCII string (with the byte order reversed in each of the four words, and with the last 4 words left unused).
The \<ID1\> folder name is derived by swapping around the byte order of the SD card CID: The CID is rotated 8-bits to the left (uh, that means the ending 00h padding byte is moved to begin?). Then, the word-order is reversed. And then, the halfwords are converted into ascii string (with byte-order for each byte-pair reversed), or so?

### 3ds:\\rw\\sys\\SecureInfo_A (111h bytes) (Region and Serial/Barcode)

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 100h  RSA-2048 signature across following 11h-bytes                  |
|       100h 1     Region (0=JPN, 1=USA, 2=EUR, 3=Reserved, 4=CHN, 5=KOR, 6=TWN)  |
|       101h 1     Normally zero                                                  |
|       102h 0Fh   Serial/Barcode, without ending check digit (ASCII, zeropadded) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The serial/barcode consists of 2-3 letters, followed by 8 digits, followed by a checksum digit.
The first letter indicates the console model:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3DS             C  (or E for devunits)                          |
|       3DS XL/LL       S  (or R for devunits)                          |
|       2DS             A  (or P for devunits)                          |
|       New 3DS         Y  (or Yxx00 for devunits)                      |
|       New 3DS XL/LL   Q  (or Qxx00 for devunits)                      |
|       New 2DS XL/LL   N  (or Nxx01 for devunits)                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The next 1-2 letter(s) indicate the region:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       JPN Japan                          JF,JH,JM                     |
|       USA North America                  W                            |
|       USA Middle East, Southeast Asia    S                            |
|       EUR Europe                         EF,EH,EM                     |
|       EUR Australia                      AG,AH                        |
|       CHN China (iQue)                   CF,CH,CM                     |
|       KOR South Korea                    KF,KH,KM                     |
|       TWN Taiwan                         ...unknown?                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The checksum digit is found on the consoles barcode sticker, but isn\'t included in the SecureInfo_A file. However, the checksum can be calculated across 1st-8th digit (and ignoring the leading letters):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       9th = (250 - (1st+3rd+5th+7th) - 3*(2nd+4th+6th+8th)) mod 10    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The RSA private key for retail is unknown. The private key for devkits is included in the devkit system updater package.
