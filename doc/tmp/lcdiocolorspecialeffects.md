# LCD I/O Color Special Effects


Two types of Special Effects are supported: Alpha Blending
(Semi-Transparency) allows to combine colors of two selected surfaces.
Brightness Increase/Decrease adjust the brightness of the selected
surface.

Selects the 1st Target layer(s) for special effects. For Alpha
Blending/Semi-Transparency, it does also select the 2nd Target layer(s),
which should have next lower display priority as the 1st Target.
However, any combinations are possible, including that all layers may be
selected as both 1st+2nd target, in that case the top-most pixel will be
used as 1st target, and the next lower pixel as 2nd target.

**4000052h - BLDALPHA - Alpha Blending Coefficients (R/W) (not W)**
Used for Color Special Effects Mode 1, and for Semi-Transparent OBJs.

```

For this effect, the top-most non-transparent pixel must be selected as
1st Target, and the next-lower non-transparent pixel must be selected as
2nd Target, if so - and only if so, then color intensities of 1st and
2nd Target are mixed together by using the parameters in BLDALPHA
register, for each pixel each R, G, B intensities are calculated
separately:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       I = MIN ( 31, I1st*EVA + I2nd*EVB )                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Otherwise - for example, if only one target exists, or if a
non-transparent non-2nd-target pixel is moved between the two targets,
or if 2nd target has higher display priority than 1st target - then only
the top-most pixel is displayed (at normal intensity, regardless of
BLDALPHA).

**4000054h - BLDY - Brightness (Fade-In/Out) Coefficient (W) (not
R/W)**
Used for Color Special Effects Modes 2 and 3.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit   Expl.                                                     |
|       0                                                               |
| -4   EVY Coefficient (Brightness) (0..16 = 0/16..16/16, 17..31=16/16) |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For each pixel each R, G, B intensities are calculated separately:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       I = I1st + (31-I1st)*EVY   ;For Brightness Increase             |
|       I = I1st - (I1st)*EVY      ;For Brightness Decrease             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The color intensities of any selected 1st target surface(s) are
increased or decreased by using the parameter in BLDY register.

**Semi-Transparent OBJs**
OBJs that are defined as \'Semi-Transparent\' in OAM memory are alway
selected as 1st Target (regardless of BLDCNT Bit 4), and are always
using Alpha Blending mode (regardless of BLDCNT Bit 6-7).
The BLDCNT register may be used to perform Brightness effects on the OBJ
(and/or other BG/BD layers). However, if a semi-transparent OBJ pixel
does overlap a 2nd target pixel, then semi-transparency becomes
priority, and the brightness effect will not take place (neither on 1st,
nor 2nd target).

**The OBJ Layer**
Before special effects are applied, the display controller computes the
OBJ priority ordering, and isolates the top-most OBJ pixel. In result,
only the top-most OBJ pixel is recursed at the time when processing
special effects. Ie. alpha blending and semi-transparency can be used
for OBJ-to-BG or BG-to-OBJ , but not for OBJ-to-OBJ.
