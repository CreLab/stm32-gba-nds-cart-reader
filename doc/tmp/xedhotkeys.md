# XED Hotkeys


XED recognizes both CP/M Wordstar hotkeys (also used by Borland PC
compilers), and Norton editor hotkeys (NU.EXE). The \"Ctrl+X,Y\" styl
hotkeys are wordstar based, particulary including good block functions.
The F4,X and Alt/Ctrl+X type hotkeys are norton based, particulary very
useful for forwards/backwards searching.

marking it\'s headline)

**Hex-Edit Keys (Binary Files)**
This mode is activated by /b commandline switch, allowing to view and
modify binary files. Aside from normal cursor keys, the following
hotkeys are used:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|                                                                       |

```

|       F7,B       Print block (or Ctrl+K,P)                            |
|       F7,E       Eject page                                           |

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

More printer options can be found in setup. Printing was working well
(at least with my own printer) in older XED versions, but it is probably
badly bugged (at least untested) for years now.
