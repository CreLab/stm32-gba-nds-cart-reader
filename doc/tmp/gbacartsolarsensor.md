# GBA Cart Solar Sensor


Uses a Photo Diode as Solar Sensor (used in Boktai, allowing to defeat vampires when the cartridge is exposed to sunlight). The cartridge comes in transparent case, and it\'s slightly longer than normal carts, so the sensor reaches out of the cartridge slot. According to the manual, the sensor works only with sunlight, but actually it works with any strong light source (eg. a 100 Watt bulb at 1-2 centimeters distance). The sensor is accessed via 4bit I/O port (only 3bits used), which is contained in the ROM-chip.

### A/D Conversion
The cartridge uses a self-made digital-ramp converter A/D converter, which is (maybe) better than measuring a capacitor charge-up time, and/or less expensive than a real ADC-chip:
It contains a 74LV4040 12bit binary counter (clocked by CPU via the I/O port), of which only the lower 8bit are used, which are passed to a resistor ladder-type D/A converter, which is generating a linear increasing voltage, which is passed to a TLV272 voltage comparator, which is passing a signal to the I/O port when the counter voltage becomes greater than the sensor voltage.

### Example Code

The results vary depending on the clock rate used. In above example, ensure that IRQs or DMAs do not interrupt the function. Alternately, use a super-slow clock rate (eg. like 666Hz used in Boktai) so that additional small IRQ/DMA delays have little effect on the overall timing. Results should be somewhat:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       E8h  total darkness (including LED light, or daylight on rainy days) |
|       Dxh  close to a 100 Watt Bulb                                        |
|       5xh  reaches max level in boktai's solar gauge                       |
|       00h  close to a tactical nuclear bomb dropped on your city           |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The exact values may change from cartridge to cartridge, so it\'d be recommened to include a darkness calibration function, prompting the user to cover the sensor for a moment (in Boktai, access Options by pressing left/right in title screen) (alternately, auto-calibration could theoretically memorize the darkest in-game level ever seen).
