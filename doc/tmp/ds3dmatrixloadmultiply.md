# DS 3D Matrix Load/Multiply


### 4000440h - Cmd 10h - MTX_MODE - Set Matrix Mode (W)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-1   Matrix Mode (0..3)                                                    |
|              0  Projection Matrix                                                 |
|              1  Position Matrix (aka Modelview Matrix)                            |
|              2  Position & Vector Simultaneous Set mode (used for Light+VEC_TEST) |
|              3  Texture Matrix (see DS 3D Texture Coordinates chapter)            |
|       2-31  Not used                                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Selects the current Matrix, all following MTX commands (load, multiply, push, pop, etc.) are applied to that matrix. In Mode 2, all MTX commands are applied to both the Position and Vector matrices. There are two special cases:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       MTX_SCALE in Mode 2:                  uses ONLY Position Matrix              |
|       MTX_PUSH/POP/STORE/RESTORE in Mode 1: uses BOTH Position AND Vector Matrices |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Ie. the four stack commands act like mode 2 (even when in mode 1; keeping the two stacks somewhat in sync), and scale acts like mode 1 (even when in mode 2; keeping the light vector length\'s intact).

### 4000454h - Cmd 15h - MTX_IDENTITY - Load Unit Matrix to Current Matrix (W)
Sets C=I. Parameters: None
The Identity Matrix (I), aka Unit Matrix, consists of all zeroes, with a diagonal row of ones. A matrix multiplied by the Unit Matrix is left unchanged.

### 4000458h - Cmd 16h - MTX_LOAD_4x4 - Load 4x4 Matrix to Current Matrix (W)
Sets C=M. Parameters: 16, m\[0..15\]

### 400045Ch - Cmd 17h - MTX_LOAD_4x3 - Load 4x3 Matrix to Current Matrix (W)
Sets C=M. Parameters: 12, m\[0..11\]

### 4000460h - Cmd 18h - MTX_MULT_4x4 - Multiply Current Matrix by 4x4 Matrix (W)
Sets C=M\*C. Parameters: 16, m\[0..15\]

### 4000464h - Cmd 19h - MTX_MULT_4x3 - Multiply Current Matrix by 4x3 Matrix (W)
Sets C=M\*C. Parameters: 12, m\[0..11\]

### 4000468h - Cmd 1Ah - MTX_MULT_3x3 - Multiply Current Matrix by 3x3 Matrix (W)
Sets C=M\*C. Parameters: 9, m\[0..8\]

### 400046Ch - Cmd 1Bh - MTX_SCALE - Multiply Current Matrix by Scale Matrix (W)
Sets C=M\*C. Parameters: 3, m\[0..2\]
Note: MTX_SCALE doesn\'t change Vector Matrix (even when in MTX_MODE=2) (that\'s done so for keeping the length of the light vector\'s intact).

### 4000470h - Cmd 1Ch - MTX_TRANS - Mult. Curr. Matrix by Translation Matrix (W)
Sets C=M\*C. Parameters: 3, m\[0..2\] (x,y,z position)

### 4000640h..67Fh - CLIPMTX_RESULT - Read Current Clip Coordinates Matrix (R)
This 64-byte region (16 words) contains the m\[0..15\] values of the Current Clip Coordinates Matrix, arranged in 4x4 Matrix format. Make sure that the Geometry Engine is stopped (GXSTAT.27) before reading from these registers.
The Clip Matrix is internally used to convert vertices to screen coordinates, and is internally re-calculated anytime when changing the Position or Projection matrices:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ClipMatrix = PositionMatrix * ProjectionMatrix                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

To read only the Position Matrix, or only the Projection Matrix: Use Load Identity on the OTHER matrix, so the ClipMatrix becomes equal to the DESIRED matrix (multiplied by the Identity Matrix, which has no effect on the result).

### 4000680h..6A3h - VECMTX_RESULT - Read Current Directional Vector Matrix (R)
This 36-byte region (9 words) contains the m\[0..8\] values of the Current Directional Vector Matrix, arranged in 3x3 Matrix format (the fourth row/column may contain any values).
Make sure that the Geometry Engine is stopped (GXSTAT.27) before reading from these registers.
