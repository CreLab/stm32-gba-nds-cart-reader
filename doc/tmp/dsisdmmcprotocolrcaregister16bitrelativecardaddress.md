# DSi SD/MMC Protocol: RCA Register (16bit Relative Card Address)


The RCA was intended for connecting multiple cards to the same host,
possibly even sharing the same signal wires for multiple cards. The
multi-card feature isn\'t used to often though.
Most hosts are having only a single card slot. And, hosts that \<do\
support multiple cards may use separate busses and even separate
controllers for each card (eg. Nintendo DSi is doing so for onboard NAND
and external SD slot).
However, even single-card systems will need to obtain a \"dummy\" RCA
and use that RCA value for selecting the card.
The only exception is SPI mode: SPI isn\'t using RCA, and doesn\'
support RCA commands at all - instead, in SPI mode, the cards are
selected via /CS signal (which may include multiple /CS signals for
multiple cards).

Ask the card to publish a new relative address (RCA).
Dunno how this is intended to work with multiple cards. The goal should
be to assign \<different\> RCAs to each card. The command should b
probably repeatedly used until all cards respond with different RCAs.
This would require the cards to contain some sort of analog random
generator - or maybe to use the CID register as random seed (the CID
seems to contain unique serial numbers per card)?

Response: R1
Assigns an RCA value TO the card (ie. the opposite of CMD3 on SD
Cards).
Dunno how this is intended to work with multiple cards. The goal should
be to assign \<different\> RCAs to each card. But actually, the comman
appears to assign the \<same\> RCA to all cards?

```

Response: R1b (only from the selected card)
Additional Data Transfer (from card): Busy signal for \"R1b\" response
Command toggles a card between the stand-by and transfer states or
between the programming and disconnect states. In both cases, the card
is selected by its own relative address and gets deselected by any other
address; address 0 deselects all.
In the case that the RCA equals 0, then the host may do one of the
following:
- Use other RCA number to perform card de-selection.
- Re-send CMD3 to change its RCA number to other than 0 and then use
CMD7 with RCA=0 for card deselection.

Response: R1b

**RCA register**
The writable 16-bit relative card address register carries the card
address that is published by the card during the card identification.
This address is used for the addressed host-card communication after the
card identification procedure. The default value of the RCA register is
0000h. The value 0000h is reserved to set all cards into the Stand-by
State with CMD7.
In UHS-II mode, Node ID is used as RCA. Refer to SD-TRAN Section of
UHS-II Addendum for more details.

**Note**
Commands GET_CSD, GET_CID, APP_CMD, GO_INACTIVE_STATE, and GET_STATUS
allow/require to specify RCA in parameter field.
Other commands are either processed by all cards (broadcast commands),
or processed only be cards that have been previously selected via CMD7
(most normal commands).

Some broadcast commands are sending responses.
SD specs are suggesting to use separate CMD lines for each card (so the
host would broadcast the same command on all CMD lines, and would
receive separate responses in parallel from each CMD line).
MMC cards are said to support open-collector CMD lines (so responses
from separate cards would be logically ORed, though, dunno what that
would be good for).
