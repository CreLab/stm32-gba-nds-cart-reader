# DS Wifi Nintendo Beacons


Beacons are most commonly used to announce Wifi Internet Access Points.
The special Nintendo Beacons are used to announce Local Network games
(randomly broadcast on channel 1, 7, or 13).

**All beacon frames transmitted by a DS host have the following
format**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       TXHDR using 2MBit/s rate                                        |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Snippet #9 contains slave names:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 2                                                          |

|                                                                       |

|       01Eh 1   Slave 3 Number*10h+Color (30h+color)     ;\            
|                                                                       |
|  01Fh 1   Slave 3 Username Length (0..10)          ; Slave 3 (if any) |
|       020h 14h Slave 3 Username (max 10 chars UCS-2)    ;/            |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: The slave Mask is initially 0000h, and isn\'t updated until AFTE
having transferred the first some Data packets.
Unknown if there can be more 62h-byte snippets appended (if any games
support 5 or more slaves).

**Authentication/Association process**
Connecting to a Host console is done via standard 802.11 managment
frames. The Auth/Assoc Requests must be sent during the listen interval
(ie. shortly after having received beacons).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Host sends beacon(s)                                            |
|                                                                       |
|  Client sends an Authentication Request (AuthSeq=1)            ;\Auth 
|                                                                       |
|      Host sends an Authentication Response (AuthSeq=2)             ;/ |
|       Host sends beacon(s)                                            |
|                                                                       |
| Client sends an Association Request (with special SSID)       ;\Assoc 
|                                                                       |
|      Host sends an Association Response                            ;/ |
|       Host sends beacon(s) and begins sending CMD/Data packets        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Nintendo Beacons are transferred without public SSID (without
Tag=00h). However, the Association Request must contain a SSID, which is
derived from the custom Tag=DDh area.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      SSID for multiboot (20h-byte binary, non-ASCII):                 |
|       00h 4   Game ID (0040xxxxh) (from Beacon Tag=DDh, entry 0Ch)    |
|       04h 2   Stream code         (from Beacon Tag=DDh, entry 10h)    |
|       06h 1Ah Zerofilled                                              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Multicart games or Pictochat may use whatever SSID\'s they want (unknow
if there is standard for that).

**Encrypted Nintendo Zone Beacon Info (with Game ID=00000857h)**
Nintendo Zone beacons are broadcast by DS consoles with special \"Beaco
Cartridges\" (that console is merely sending beacons, it doesn\'t act a
an Access Point itself. Instead, the beacon contains the SSID/password
for the actual Access Point in the Shop/Restaurant, or for your own home
network).
The SSID/Password in the Zone Beacons can be also used by DSi games and
- DSi browser (depending on the Flags at \[66h\]).

- |  CRC16 with initial value 0 across [00h..6Dh] (or optionally 0=NoCrc) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The above 70h-bytes are RC4 encrypted (the WEP encryption algorithm)
with an 8-byte key:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       Key[0..3] = "!SDW" (aka "WDS!" backwards)                       |
- |       Key[4..7] = Last 4 bytes of the 6-byte BSSID from Beacon header |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When receiving the Nintendo Zone beacon, DSi Launcher will add some
animation to the Nintendo Zone icon. The Nintendo Zone tool will
occassionally show a green signal strength symbol in upper right (if the
SSID and WEP password match for your Access Point). Moreover, the tool
should then connect to the server (supposedly using the ApNum entry),
but that step seems to fail, probably because Nintendo has shut down the
Zone servers someday in 2016-2018.
ApNum:
\"Authentication parameter, required for connecting to the server
server uses this to determine which third-party content to link to on
the index page. First ASCII number char in this param is region, this is
also used to determine which server to connect to. Regions: 0=JP, 1=USA,
2/3=EUR, 4=KOR, 5=China, ?=TWN.\" Uh, unknown if those \"digits\" ar
letters or digits? There is a screenshot showing \"1BBUSMN000\" fo
Bestbuy. The 3DS has a hotspot.conf file with numeric ApNums, eg.
\"2013300000\". Unknown if the region digit is required to match th
console region.
