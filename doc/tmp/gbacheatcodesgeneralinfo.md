# GBA Cheat Codes - General Info


Cheat devices are external adapters, connected between the GBA and the game cartridge. The devices include a BIOS ROM which is, among others, used to prompt the user to enter cheat codes.
These codes are used to patch specified memory locations for a certain GBA game, allowing the user to gain goodies such like Infinite sex, 255 Cigarettes, etc.

### ROM and RAM Patches
For ROM Patches, the device watches the address bus, if it matches a specified address then it outputs a patched value to the data bus, that mechanism is implemented by hardware, aside from the Hook Enable Code some devices also allow a limited number of cheats to use ROM patches.
Most cheat codes are RAM patches, each time when the hook procedure is executed it will process all codes and overwrite the specified addresses in RAM (or VRAM or I/O area) by the desired values.

### Enable Codes (Must Be On)
Enable codes usually consist of the Game ID, Hook Address, and eventually a third code used to encrypt all following codes. The Game ID is used to confirm that the correct cartridge is inserted, just a verification, though the device may insist on the ID code.
The Hook Address specifies an address in cartridge ROM, and should point to an opcode which is executed several times per second (eg. once per frame, many codes place the hook in the joypad handler). At the hook address, the device redirects to its own BIOS, processes the RAM patches, and does then return control to the game cartridge.
Note: The hook address should not point to opcodes with relative addressing (eg. B, BL, LDR Rd,=Imm, ADD Rd,=Imm opcodes - which are all relative to PC program counter register).

### Alignment
Addresses for 16bit or 32bit values should be properly aligned.
