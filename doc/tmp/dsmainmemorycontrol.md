# DS Main Memory Control


**Main Memory**
The DS Main Memory is 2Mx16bit (4MByte), 1.8V Pseudo SRAM (PSRAM); all
Dynamic RAM refresh is handled internally, the chip doesn\'t require an
external refresh signals, and alltogether behaves like Static RAM.
Non-sequential access time is 70ns, sequential (burst) access time is
12ns.

**Main Memory Control**
The memory chips contain built-in Control functions, which can be
accessed via Port 27FFFFEh and/or by EXMEMCNT Bit 14. Nintendo is using
at least two different types of memory chips in DS consoles, Fujitsu
82DBS02163C-70L, and ST M69AB048BL70ZA8, both appear to have different
control mechanisms, other chips (with 8MB size) are used in the
semi-professional DS hardware debuggers, and further chips may be used
in future, so using the memory control functions may lead into
compatibitly problems.

**Power Consumption / Power Control**
Power Consumption during operation (read/write access) is somewhat 30mA,
in standby mode (no read/write access) consumption is reduced to 100uA.
Furthermore, a number of power-down modes are supported: In \"Deep\
Power Down mode the refresh is fully disabled, consumption is 10uA (and
all data will be lost), in \"Partial\" Power Down modes only fragment o
memory is refreshed, for smallest fragments, consumption goes to down to
circa 50uA. The chip cannot be accessed while it is in Deep or Partial
Power Down mode.

**Fujitsu 82DBS02163C-70L**
The Configuration Register (CR) can be written to by the following
sequence:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       LDRH R0,[27FFFFEh]      ;read one value                         |
- |       STRH R0,[27FFFFEh]      ;write should be same value as above    |
- |       STRH R0,[27FFFFEh]      ;write should be same value as above    |
- |       STRH R0,[27FFFFEh]      ;write any value                        |
- |       STRH R0,[27FFFFEh]      ;write any value                        |
|                                                                       |
- | LDRH R0,[2400000h+CR*2] ;read, address-bits are defining new CR value |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Do not access any other Main Memory addresses during above sequence (ie.
disable interrupts, and do not execute the sequence by code located in
Main Memory). The CR value is write-only. The CR bits are:

```

|               In Mode 1 (Async), only the Partial Size bits are used, |
|               all other bits, CR bits 0..18, must be "1".             |
|       16-18                                                           |

|  19-20  Partial Size     (0=1MB, 1=512KB, 2=Reserved, 3=Deep/0 bytes) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Power Down mode is entered by setting CE2=LOW, this can be probably
done by setting EXMEMCNT Bit14 to zero.

**ST Microelectronics M69AB048BL70ZA8**
The chip name decodes as PSRAM (M96), Asynchronous (A), 1.8V Burst (B),
2Mx16 (048), Two Chip Enables (B), Low Leakage (L), 70ns (70), Package
(ZA), -30..+85\'C (8).
There are three data sheets for different PSRAM chips available at
www.st.com (unfortunately none for M69AB048BL70ZA8), each using
different memory control mechanisms.

**NDS9 BIOS**
The NDS9 BIOS contains the following Main Memory initialization code,
that method doesn\'t match up with any ST (nor Fujitsu) data sheets tha
I\'ve seen. At its best, it looks like a strange (and presumabl
non-functional) mix-up of different ST control methods.
