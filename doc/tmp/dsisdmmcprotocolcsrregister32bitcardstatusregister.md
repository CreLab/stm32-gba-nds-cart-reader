+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

SPI Mode Response: R2 (16bit Card Status):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
| 15-0    CSR Card Status Register (16bit) (see below)  ;-1st..2nd byte |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Addressed card sends its status register.

**CMDxx/ACMDxx - Other Commands**
Most other commands are also returning the Card Status in their
responses:
SD Mode Response: R1 (32bit Card Status)
SPI Mode Response: R1 (8bit Card Status; most SPI commands return only
8bit)
SPI Mode Response: R2 (16bit Card Status; SPI commands CMD13/ACMD return
16bit)

**CMDxx/ACMDxx - Other Commands with R1b Response**
R1b is identical to R1, with an optional busy signal transmitted on the
DATA line (R1b occurs for CMD7, CMD12, CMD20, CMD28, CMD29, CMD38) (and
for MMC: also for CMD5, CMD6). The card may become busy after receiving
these commands based on its state prior to the command reception. The
Host shall check for busy at the response.
In SD Mode, the busy signal is sent on DAT0 line (DAT1-3 aren\'t used
even if the card is in 4bit mode). The busy signal does consist of BITs?
(not bytes?), and has a \"start bit\"?, followed b
what-value-when-busy? and what-final-value-when-ready?
In SPI Mode, the busy signal is sent as BYTEs (00h=Busy,
xxh=Nonzero=Ready).

affected bits in the status field. An \'x\' means the error/status bi
may be set in the response to the respective command.
