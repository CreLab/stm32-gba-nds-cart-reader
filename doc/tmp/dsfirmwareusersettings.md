```

Note: The DSi does store the user settings in eMMC files (TWLCFGn.dat),
that files include NDS-style settings (username etc), plus additional
DSi-specific settings (country, parental controls, etc). For backwards
compatibilty, the DSi does also store a copy of those settings in
NDS-style format in Wifi FLASH and Main RAM at 2FFFC80h.
- [DSi SD/MMC Firmware System Settings DataFiles](./dsisdmmcfirmwaresystemsettingsdatafiles.md)
DSi Backlight level and DSi sound volume seem to be stored in the BPTWL
chip (or possibly in its attached I2C potentiometer).

**Language and Flags (Entry 064h)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0..2 Language (0=Japanese, 1=English, 2=French, 3=German,       |

|     4=Italian, 5=Spanish, 6..7=Reserved) (for Chinese see Entry 075h) |
|            (the language setting also implies time/data format)       |
|       3    GBA mode screen selection (0=Upper, 1=Lower)               |
|       4-5  Backlight Level    (0..3=Low,Med,High,Max) (DS-Lite only)  |
|                                                                       |
|    6    Bootmenu Disable   (0=Manual/bootmenu, 1=Autostart Cartridge) |
|       7-8  ?                                                          |
|       9                                                               |
| Settings Lost (1=Prompt for User Info, and Language, and Calibration) |
|       10   Settings Okay (0=Prompt for User Info)                     |
|       11   Settings Okay (0=Prompt for User Info) (Same as Bit10)     |
|       12   No function                                                |
|       13   Settings Okay (0=Prompt for User Info, and Language)       |
|       14   Settings Okay (0=Prompt for User Info) (Same as Bit10)     |
|       15   Settings Okay (0=Prompt for User Info) (Same as Bit10)     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Health and Safety message is skipped if Bit9=1, or if one or more of
the following bits is zero: Bits 10,11,13,14,15. However, as soon as
entering the bootmenu, the Penalty-Prompt occurs.

Note: There are two User Settings areas in the firmware chip, at offset
3FE00h and 3FF00h, if both areas have valid CRCs, then the
current/newest area is that whose Update Counter is one bigger than in
the other/older area.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|      IF count1=((count0+1) AND 7Fh) THEN area1=newer ELSE area0=newer |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When changing settings, the older area is overwritten with new data (and
incremented Update Counter). The two areas allow to recover previous
settings in case of a write-error (eg. on a battery failure during
write).

**Battery Removal**
Even though the battery is required only for the RTC (not for the
firmware flash memory), most of the firmware user settings are reset
when removing the battery. This appears to be a strange bug-or-feature
of the DS bios, at least, fortunately, it still keeps the rest of the
firmware intact.
