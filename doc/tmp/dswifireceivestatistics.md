Bitmask for which statistics have been increased at least once.
Unknown how to reset/acknowledge these bits (neither reading/writing
48081A8h, nor reading 48081B0h..1BFh, nor writing 48081ACh seem to
work).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The W_RXSTAT_OVF_IF bits are simply containing the current bit7-value of
the corresponding counters, setting or clearing that counter bits is
directly reflected to W_RXSTAT_OVF_IF.
The recommended way to acknowledge W_RXSTAT_OVF_IF is to read the
corresponding counters (which are reset to 00h after reading). For some
reason, the firmware is additionally writing FFFFh to W_RXSTAT_OVF_IF
(that is possibly a bug, or it does acknowledge something internally?).

**48081B0h..1BFh - W_RXSTAT - Receive Statistics (R/W, except 1B5h:
Read-only)**
W_RXSTAT is a collection of 8bit counters, which are incremented upon
certain events. These entries are automatically reset to 0000h after
reading. Should be accessed with LDRH opcodes (using LDRB to read only
8bits does work, but the read is internally expanded to 16bit, and so,
the whole 16bit value will be reset to 0000h).

Increments when receiving a packet. Automatically reset to zero after
reading.

**48081D0h..1DFh - W_CMD_STAT - Multiplay Response Error Counters
(R/W)**
The multiplay error counters are only used when sending a multiplay
command (via W_TXBUF_CMD) to any connected slaves (which must be
indicated by flags located in the second halfword of the multiplay
command\'s frame body).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| 1h..1DFh  Client 1..15 Response Error (increments on missing replies) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

If one or more of those slaves fail to respond, then the corresponding
error counters get incremented (at the master side). Automatically reset
to zero after reading.
Unknown if these counters do also increment at the slave side?
