+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Interrupts (and DMAs) should be disabled during command/write phase.
Target address must be a multiple of 80h.

**Write Single Data Byte (all device types, except Atmel)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- |  [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=A0h  (write byte command) |
- |       [E00xxx                                                         |
| xh]=dat                                  (write byte to address xxxx) |
- |       wait until [E00xxxxh]=dat (or timeout)                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The target memory location must have been previously erased.

**Terminate Command after Timeout (only Macronix devices, ID=1CC2h)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       [E00555                                                         |
| 5h]=F0h                            (force end of write/erase command) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Use if timeout occurred during \"wait until\" periods, for Macroni
devices only.

**Bank Switching (devices bigger than 64K only)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- | [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=B0h  (select bank command) |
- |       [E0                                                             |
| 00000h]=bnk                                  (write bank number 0..1) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Specifies 64K bank number for read/write/erase operations.
Required because gamepak flash/sram addressbus is limited to 16bit
width.

**Device Types**
Nintendo puts different FLASH chips in commercial game cartridges.
Developers should thus detect & support all chip types. For Atmel chips
it\'d be recommended to simulate 4K sectors by software, thoug
reportedly Nintendo doesn\'t use Atmel chips in newer games anymore
Also mind that different timings should not disturb compatibility and
performance.

Identification Codes MSB=Device Type, LSB=Manufacturer.
Size in bytes, and numbers of sectors \* sector size in bytes.
Average medium Write, Erase Sector, Erase Chips timings are unknown?
Timeouts in milliseconds for Write, Erase Sector, Erase Chips.
Waitstates for Writes, and Reads in clock cycles.

**Accessing FLASH Memory**
FLASH memory is located in the \"SRAM\" area at E000000h..E00FFFFh
which is restricted to 16bit address and 8bit data buswidths.
Respectively, the memory can be accessed \<only\> by 8bit read/writ
LDRB/STRB opcodes.
Also, reading anything (data or status/busy information) can be done
\<only\> by opcodes executed in WRAM (not from opcodes in ROM) (there\'
no such restriction for writing).

**FLASH Waitstates**
Use 8 clk waitstates for initial detection (WAITCNT Bits 0,1 both set).
After detection of certain device types smaller wait values may be used
for write/erase, and even smaller wait values for raw reading, see
Device Types table.
In practice, games seem to use smaller values only for write/erase (even
though those operations are slow anyways), whilst raw reads are always
done at 8 clk waits (even though reads could actually benefit slightly
from smaller wait values).

**Verify Write/Erase and Retry**
Even though device signalizes the completion of write/erase operations,
it\'d be recommended to read/confirm the content of the changed memor
area by software. In practice, Nintendo\'s \"erase-write-verify-retry\
function typically repeats the operation up to three times in case of
errors.
Also, for SST devices only, the \"erase-write\" an
\"erase-write-verify-retry\" functions repeat the erase command up to 8
times, additionally followed by one further erase command if no retries
were needed, otherwise followed by six further erase commands.

**Note**
FLASH (64Kbytes) is used by the game Sonic Advance, and possibly
others.
