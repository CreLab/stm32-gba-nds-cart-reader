### Chip Identification (all device types)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=90h  (enter ID mode)             |
|       dev=[E000001h], man=[E000000h]                  (get device & manufacturer) |
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=F0h  (terminate ID mode)         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Used to detect the type (and presence) of FLASH chips. See Device Types below.

### Reading Data Bytes (all device types)

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       dat=[E00xxxxh]                                  (read byte from address xxxx) |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Erase Entire Chip (all device types)

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=80h  (erase command)     |
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=10h  (erase entire chip) |
|       wait until [E000000h]=FFh (or timeout)                              |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Erases all memory in chip, erased memory is FFh-filled.

### Erase 4Kbyte Sector (all device types, except Atmel)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=80h  (erase command)  |
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E00n000h]=30h  (erase sector n) |
|       wait until [E00n000h]=FFh (or timeout)                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Erases memory at E00n000h..E00nFFFh, erased memory is FFh-filled.

### Erase-and-Write 128 Bytes Sector (only Atmel devices)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       old=IME, IME=0                                  (disable interrupts)         |
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=A0h  (erase/write sector command) |
|       [E00xxxxh+00h..7Fh]=dat[00h..7Fh]               (write 128 bytes)            |
|       IME=old                                         (restore old IME state)      |
|       wait until [E00xxxxh+7Fh]=dat[7Fh] (or timeout)                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Interrupts (and DMAs) should be disabled during command/write phase. Target address must be a multiple of 80h.

### Write Single Data Byte (all device types, except Atmel)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=A0h  (write byte command)         |
|       [E00xxxxh]=dat                                  (write byte to address xxxx) |
|       wait until [E00xxxxh]=dat (or timeout)                                       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The target memory location must have been previously erased.

### Terminate Command after Timeout (only Macronix devices, ID=1CC2h)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [E005555h]=F0h                            (force end of write/erase command) |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Use if timeout occurred during \"wait until\" periods, for Macronix devices only.

### Bank Switching (devices bigger than 64K only)

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       [E005555h]=AAh, [E002AAAh]=55h, [E005555h]=B0h  (select bank command)    |
|       [E000000h]=bnk                                  (write bank number 0..1) |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Specifies 64K bank number for read/write/erase operations.
Required because gamepak flash/sram addressbus is limited to 16bit width.

### Device Types
Nintendo puts different FLASH chips in commercial game cartridges. Developers should thus detect & support all chip types. For Atmel chips it\'d be recommended to simulate 4K sectors by software, though reportedly Nintendo doesn\'t use Atmel chips in newer games anymore. Also mind that different timings should not disturb compatibility and performance.

Identification Codes MSB=Device Type, LSB=Manufacturer.

Average medium Write, Erase Sector, Erase Chips timings are unknown?
Timeouts in milliseconds for Write, Erase Sector, Erase Chips.
Waitstates for Writes, and Reads in clock cycles.

### Accessing FLASH Memory
FLASH memory is located in the \"SRAM\" area at E000000h..E00FFFFh, which is restricted to 16bit address and 8bit data buswidths. Respectively, the memory can be accessed \<only\> by 8bit read/write LDRB/STRB opcodes.
Also, reading anything (data or status/busy information) can be done \<only\> by opcodes executed in WRAM (not from opcodes in ROM) (there\'s no such restriction for writing).

### FLASH Waitstates
Use 8 clk waitstates for initial detection (WAITCNT Bits 0,1 both set). After detection of certain device types smaller wait values may be used for write/erase, and even smaller wait values for raw reading, see Device Types table.
In practice, games seem to use smaller values only for write/erase (even though those operations are slow anyways), whilst raw reads are always done at 8 clk waits (even though reads could actually benefit slightly from smaller wait values).

### Verify Write/Erase and Retry
Even though device signalizes the completion of write/erase operations, it\'d be recommended to read/confirm the content of the changed memory area by software. In practice, Nintendo\'s \"erase-write-verify-retry\" function typically repeats the operation up to three times in case of errors.
Also, for SST devices only, the \"erase-write\" and \"erase-write-verify-retry\" functions repeat the erase command up to 80 times, additionally followed by one further erase command if no retries were needed, otherwise followed by six further erase commands.

### Note
FLASH (64Kbytes) is used by the game Sonic Advance, and possibly others.
