All channels can be accessed in Single-Ended mode.
In differential mode, only channel 1,3,4,5 (X,Z1,Z2,Y) can be accessed.
On AK4148AVT, channel 6 (AUX) is split into two separate channels, IN1
and IN2, separated by Bit2 (Reference Select). IN1 is selected when
Bit2=1, IN2 is selected when Bit2=0 (despite of the Bit2 settings, both
IN1 and IN2 are using single ended more). On the NDS-Lite, IN1 connects
to the mircrophone (as on original NDS), and the new IN2 input is simply
wired to VDD3.3 (which is equal to the external VREF voltage, so IN2 is
always FFFh).

```

Allows to enable/disable the /PENIRQ output, the internal reference
voltage (VREF), and the Analogue-Digital Converter.
For AK4148AVT, Power Down modes are slightly different (among others,
/PENIRQ is enabled in Mode 0..2).

**Reference Voltage (VREF)**
VREF is used as reference voltage in single ended mode, at 12bit
resolution one ADC step equals to VREF/4096. The TSC generates an
internal VREF of 2.5V (+/-0.05V), however, the NDS uses as external VREF
of 3.33V (sinks to 3.31V at low battery charge), the external VREF is
always enabled, no matter if internal VREF is on or off. Power Down Mode
1 disables the internal VREF, which may reduce power consumption in
single ended mode. After conversion, Power Down Mode 0 should be
restored to re-enable the Penirq signal.

**Sending the first Command after Chip-Select**
Switch chipselect low, then output the command byte (MSB first).

**Reply Data**
The following reply data is received (via Input line) after the Command
byte has been transferred: One dummy bit (zero), followed by the 8bit or
12bit conversion result (MSB first), followed by endless padding
(zero).
Note: The returned ADC value may become unreliable if there are longer
delays between sending the command, and receiving the reply byte(s).

**Sending further Commands during/after receiving Reply Data**
In general, the Output line should be LOW during the reply period,
however, once when Data bit6 has been received (or anytime later), a new
Command can be invoked (started by sending the HIGH-startbit, ie.
Command bit7), simultaneously, the remaining reply-data bits (bit5..0)
can be received.
In other words, the new command can be output after receiving 3 bits in
8bit mode (the dummy bit, and data bits 7..6), or after receiving 7 bits
in 12bit mode (the dummy bit, and data bits 11..6).
In practice, the NDS SPI register always transfers 8 bits at once, so
that one would usually receive 8 bits (rather than above 3 or 7 bits),
before outputting a new command.

**Touchscreen Position**
Read the X and Y positions in 12bit differential mode, then convert the
touchscreen values (adc) to screen/pixel positions (scr), as such:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       sc                                                              |
| r.x = (adc.x-adc.x1) * (scr.x2-scr.x1) / (adc.x2-adc.x1) + (scr.x1-1) |
|       sc                                                              |
| r.y = (adc.y-adc.y1) * (scr.y2-scr.y1) / (adc.y2-adc.y1) + (scr.y1-1) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The X1,Y1 and X2,Y2 calibration points are found in Firmware User
Settings,
- [DS Firmware User Settings](./dsfirmwareusersettings.md)
scr.x1,y1,x2,y2 are originated at 1,1 (converted to 0,0 by above
formula).

**Touchscreen Pressure (not supported on DSi)**
To calculate the pressure resistance, in respect to X/Y/Z positions and
X/Y plate resistances, either of below formulas can be used,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Rtouch = (Rx_plate*Xpos*(Z2pos/Z1pos-1))/4096                   |
|       Rtouch = (Rx_plate*Xpos*(4096/Z1pos-1)-Ry_plate*(1-Ypos))/4096  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The second formula requires less CPU load (as it doesn\'t require t
measure Z2), the downside is that one must know both X and Y plate
resistance (or at least their ratio). The first formula doesn\'t requir
that ratio, and so Rx_plate can be set to any value, setting it to 4096
results in

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       touchval = Xpos*(Z2pos/Z1pos-1)                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Of course, in that case, touchval is just a number, not a resistance in
Ohms.

**Touchscreen Notes**
It may be impossible to press locations close to the screen borders.
When pressing two or more locations the TSC values will be somewhere in
the middle of these locations.
The TSC values may be garbage if the screen becomes newly pressed or
released, to avoid invalid inputs: read TSC values at least two times,
and ignore BOTH positions if ONE position was invalid.

**Microphone / AUX Channel**
Observe that the microphone amplifier is switched off after power up,
see:
- [DS Power Management Device](./dspowermanagementdevice.md)
- [DS Power Control](./dspowercontrol.md)

**Temperature Calculation (not supported on DSi)**
TP0 decreases by circa 2.1mV per degree Kelvin. The voltage difference
between TP1 minus TP0 increases by circa 0.39mV (1/2573 V) per degree
Kelvin. At VREF=3.33V, one 12bit ADC step equals to circa 0.8mV
(VREF/4096).
Temperature can be calculated at best resolution when using the current
TP0 value, and two calibration values (an ADC value, and the
corresponding temperature in degrees kelvin):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       K = (CAL.TP0-ADC.TP0) * 0.4 + CAL.KELVIN                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Alternately, temperature can be calculated at rather bad resolution, but
without calibration, by using the difference between TP1 and TP0:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       K = (ADC.TP1-ADC.TP0) * 8568 / 4096                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

To convert Kelvin to other formats,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Celsius:     C = (K-273.15)                                     |
|       Fahrenheit:  F = (K-273.15)*9/5+32                              |
|       Reaumur:     R = (K-273.15)*4/5                                 |
|       Rankine:     X = (K)*9/5                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Temperature Range for the TSC 2046 chip is -40\'C..+85\'C (fo
AK4181AVT only -20\'C..+70\'C). According to Nintendo, the DS should no
be exposed to \"extreme\" heat or cold, the optimal battery chargin
temperature is specified as +10\'C..+40\'C.
The original firmware does not support temperature calibration,
calibration is supported by nocash firmware (if present). See Extended
Settings,

```


For AK4181AVT, same pins as above, except that IOVDD replaced by the new
IN2 input, the pin is wired to VDD3.3 (so IN2 is always equal to VREF,
which is wired to VDD3.3, too) (and AUX is renamed to IN1, and is kept
used for MIC input).

**DSi Touchscreen Controller (in NDS mode)**
DSi in NDS mode does support only X, Y, and MIC (all other channels do
return FFFh in 12bit mode, and FFh in 8bit mode, ie. no pressure, no
temperature, and no GNDed battery sensor). On DSi, MIC does return data
in both single-ended and differential mode (unlike as on real NDS).

**DSi Touchscreen Controller (in DSi mode)**
The DSi touchscreen controller supports a NDS backwards compatibility
mode. But, in DSi mode, it is working entirely different (it\'s stil
accessed via SPI bus, but with some new MODE/INDEX values).
- [DSi Touchscreen/Sound Controller](./dsitouchscreensoundcontroller.md)
The NDS Touchscreen controller did additionally allow to read
Temperature and Touchscreen Pressure - unknown if the DSi is also
supporting such stuff (via whatever DSi-specific registers).
The touchscreen hardware can be switched to NDS compatibility mode (for
older games), but unknown how to do that.
