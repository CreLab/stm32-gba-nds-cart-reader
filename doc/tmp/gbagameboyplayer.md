# GBA Gameboy Player


The Gameboy Player is an \"adapter\" for the Gamecube console. It\'
basicly is a GBA in a black box without LCD screen and without buttons,
connected to an expansion port at the bottom of the Gamecube. The
Gamecube is then capturing the GBA video output (and passing it to the
television set), and in the other direction, passing the Gamecube joypad
input to the GBA inputs.

**Unlocking and Detecting Gameboy Player Functions**
Both unlocking and detection requires to display the 240x160 pixel
Gameboy Player logo (44 colors) for a number of frames\... maybe a
least 3-4 frames? not sure if it checks the color of the logo\... s
maybe it can be hidden by using dark gray on black background?
While displaying this logo, the joypad data will switch between values
03FFh (2 frames duration) and 030Fh (1 frame duration). The latter value
(left, right, up, down all pressed) indicates that it\'s a Gamebo
Player.

**Palette**
Knowing Nintendo, they\'ve probably not reproduced the blurred GB
colors (?), so the games won\'t look as desired on the TV screen. Unles
the game does detect the Gameboy Player, and adjust the colors
accordingly by software.

**Rumble**
The only known existing special function is the joypad rumble function,
controlled by sending data through the serial port (the normal GBA port,
even though it also has the connectors).

The Game Boy Player added a rumble feature to certain Game Boy Advance
games when played with a GameCube controller. Those games included:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Drill Dozer (supports BOTH handheld-rumble and GBP-rumble?)      |
|      Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga                                    |
|      Pokemon Pinball: Ruby & Sapphire                                 |
|      Shikakui Atama wo Marukusuru Advance: Kokugo Sansu Rika Shakai   |
|      Shikakui Atama wo Marukusuru Advance: Kanji Keisan               |
|      Summon Night Craft Sword Monogatari: Hajimari no Ishi            |
|      Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


Fredrik Olsson (aka Flubba) has implemented rumble in 3 applications now
RumblePong (FluBBA) (homebrew)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Remudvance (FluBBA) (homebrew)                                  |
|       G                                                               |
| oomba (FluBBA) (8bit Gameboy Color Emulator for 32bit GBA) (homebrew) |
|       and, supposedly in "Tetanus on Drugs" (Tepples) (homebrew)      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


The GBP can also use some of the extra controllers for the GC like the
Bongas
from Donkey Konga.

The logo requires at least 256 colors, it doesn\'t matter if you use 
tiled
screen mode or a bitmapped one, the logo can be ripped from either
\"Pokemon Pinball\" or \"Super Mario Advance 4\".

**Rumble**
After detecting/unlocking the Gameboy Player, init RCNT and SIOCNT to
32bit normal mode, external clock, SO=high, with IRQ enabled, and set
the transfer start bit. You should then receive the following sequence
(about once per frame), and your serial IRQ handler should send
responses accordingly:

```

|       Receive  Response                                               |

The first part of the transfer just contains the string \"NINTENDO\
split into 16bit fragments, and bitwise inversions thereof (eg.
494Eh=\"NI\", and B6B1h=NOT 494Eh). In the second part, \<yy\> should b
04h=RumbleOff, or 26h=RumbleOn.

**Note**
If it\'s having a similar range of functions as the 8bit Super Gameboy
then the Gameboy Player might be also able to access analogue joypad
input, and to access other features of the Gamecube hardware, up to
possibly executing code on the Gamecube CPU\...?
