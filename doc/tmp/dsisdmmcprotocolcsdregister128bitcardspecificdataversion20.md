# DSi SD/MMC Protocol: CSD Register (128bit Card-Specific Data) Version 2.0


**CSD Register (CSD Version 2.0) (SDHC/SDXC)**
The field name in parenthesis is set to fixed value and indicates that
the host is not necessary to refer these fields. The fixed values
enables host, which refers to these fields, to keep compatibility to CSD
Version 1.0.
The Cell Type field is coded as follows: R=readable, W(1)=writable once,
W=multiple writable.

**C_SIZE**
This field is expanded to 22 bits and can indicate up to 2 TBytes (that
is the same as the maximum memory space specified by a 32-bit block
address.)
This parameter is used to calculate the user data area capacity in the
SD memory card (not include the protected area). The user data area
capacity is calculated from C_SIZE as follows:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       memory capacity = (C_SIZE+1) * 512KByte                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Minimum user area size of SDHC Card is 4,211,712 sectors (2GB +
8.5MB).
The Minimum value of C_SIZE for SDHC in CSD Version 2.0 is 001010h
(4112).
The Maximum user area size of SDHC Card is (32GB - 80MB).
The Maximum value of C_SIZE for SDHC in CSD Version 2.0 is 00FF5Fh
(65375).
The Minimum user area size of SDXC Card is 67,108,864 sectors (32GB).
The Minimum value of C_SIZE for SDXC in CSD Version 2.0 is 00FFFFh
(65535).

**TRAN_SPEED**
TRAN_SPEED is variable depends on bus speed mode of SD Interface.
When CMD0 is received, this field is reset to 32h.
On SDSC (but not SDHC/SDXC), CMD6 does the same reset stuff?

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       32h   SDSC/SDHC/SDXC in Default Speed mode (25MHz)              |
|       5Ah   SDSC/SDHC/SDXC in High Speed mode    (50MHz)              |
|       0Bh   SDHC/SDXC in SDR50 or DDR50 mode     (100Mbit/sec)        |
|       2Bh   SDHC/SDXC in SDR104 mode             (200Mbit/sec)        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

UHS-II mode is not related to this field.

**CCC, DSR_IMP, COPY, PERM_WRITE_PROTECT, TMP_WRITE_PROTECT**
Definition of these fields is same as in CSD Version 1.0.

**TAAC, NSAC, R2W_FACTOR**
In SDHC/SDXC, these fields should be fixed to TAAC=0Eh (1 ms), NSAC=00h,
and R2W_FACTOR=02h (mul4).
The host should not use TAAC, NSAC, and R2W_FACTOR to calculate timeout
and should uses fixed timeout values for read and write operations (See
4.6.2).

**READ_BL_LEN, WRITE_BL_LEN**
These two fields are fixed to 9h (which indicates 512 Bytes).

**READ_BL_PARTIAL, WRITE_BL_PARTIAL, READ_BLK_MISALIGN,
WRITE_BLK_MISALIGN**
These four fields are fixed to 0 (partial block read and physical page
crossing prohibited for block read/write).

**SECTOR_SIZE**
This field is fixed to 7Fh, which indicates 64 KBytes. This value is not
related to erase operation. SDHC and SDXC Cards indicate memory boundary
by AU size and this field should not be used.

**ERASE_BLK_EN**
This field is fixed to 1, which means the host can erase one or multiple
units of 512 bytes.

**WP_GRP_SIZE, WP_GRP_ENABLE**
These field are fixed to WP_GRP_SIZE=00h, and WP_GRP_ENABLE=0.
SDHC and SDXC Cards do not support write protected groups.

**FILE_FORMAT_GRP**
**FILE_FORMAT**
These fields are set to 0. Host should not use these fields.
