# 3DS I2C MCU\[30h-3Fh\] - Real-Time Clock (RTC)


- **MCU\[30h\] - RTC Time second (7bit) (BCD, 00h..59h) (R/W)**
- **MCU\[31h\] - RTC Time minute (7bit) (BCD, 00h..59h) (R/W)**
- **MCU\[32h\] - RTC Time hour (6bit) (BCD, 00h..23h) (R/W)**
- **MCU\[33h\] - RTC Time day of week (3bit) (00h..06h=Blah) (R/W)**
- **MCU\[34h\] - RTC Time day (6bit) (BCD, 01h..31h) (R/W)**
- **MCU\[35h\] - RTC Time month (5bit) (BCD, 01h..12h) (R/W)**
- **MCU\[36h\] - RTC Time year (8bit) (BCD, 00h..99h) (R/W)**
Caution: The 3DS is mis-using the MCU RTC registers for counting \"tim
since power-up\" (with the DD-MM-YY HH:MM:SS values converted int
seconds). The actual time/date is computed by adding a nanosecond offset
from the BlkID=00030001h entry in \"config\" file to the MCU RT
values.

Summary: The MCU RTC values have no direct relation the actual time and
date. For example, if the battery was removed 13 months ago in June,
- it\'s perfectly normal to see MCU\[35h\]=Month=02h in July.
Note: For Day of Week, the Renesas datasheet recommends to use 0=Sunday,
but the 3DS doesn\'t really use that register (apart from setting it t
1=Day when powered up).
Unknown if the RTC treats Year=00h as leap year (centuries are a special
case, maybe that\'s why the MCU starts in Year=01h).

After battery loss, the register is 00h, the 3DS firmware changes it to
the RTC Correction value from \"config\" or HWCAL files.

Alarm. Unknown how to enable/disable that feature (other than using a
far-away date, or even using a non-BCD date). Also unknown if alarm is
working while powered off, or while playing a game.

```

This register seens to enter some low power sleep mode. It should be
normally always zero, nonzero settings can cause problems even after
reset or power off:
Bit0=1 prevents to power the console back on (the only way to fix that
is to do a full power off by opening the battery lid and removing the
battery).
Bit1=1 disables the wifi clock, and the clock remains off even after
- reboot via MCU\[20h\] (to avoid that, best set MCU\[3Fh\]=00h before an
after reboot).

**Legacy RTC Emulation**
The 3DS can emulate GBA/NDS/DSi RTC\'s. That is, the 3DS software mus
read the battery-backed time from MCU RTC registers, and then copy it to
the emulated RTC registers\...

GBA Cartridge RTC:
