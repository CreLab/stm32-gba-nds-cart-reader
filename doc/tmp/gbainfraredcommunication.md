# GBA Infrared Communication


Early GBA prototypes have been intended to include a built-in IR port
for sending and receiving IR signals. Among others, this port could have
been used to communicate with other GBAs, or older CGB models, or TV
Remote Controls, etc.

- \[ THE INFRARED COMMUNICATION FEATURE IS -NOT- SUPPORTED ANYMORE \]
Anyways, the prototype specifications have been as shown below\...

Keep in mind that the IR signal may be interrupted by whatever objects
moved between sender and receiver - the IR port isn\'t recommended fo
programs that require realtime data exchange (such like action games).

When IRQ is enabled, an interrupt is requested if the incoming signal
was 0.119us Off (2 cycles), followed by 0.536us On (9 cycles) - minimum
timing periods each.

**Transmission Notes**
When transmitting an IR signal, note that it\'d be not a good idea t
keep the LED turned On for a very long period (such like sending a 1
second synchronization pulse). The recipient\'s circuit would treat suc
a long signal as \"normal IR pollution which is in the air\" after 
while, and thus ignore the signal.

**Reception Notes**
Received data is internally latched. Latched data may be read out by
setting both READ and AMP bits.
Note: Provided that you don\'t want to receive your own IR signal, b
sure to set Bit 0 to zero before attempting to receive data.

**Power-consumption**
After using the IR port, be sure to reset the register to zero in order
to reduce battery power consumption.
