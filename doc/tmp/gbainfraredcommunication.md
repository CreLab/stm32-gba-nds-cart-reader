# GBA Infrared Communication


Early GBA prototypes have been intended to include a built-in IR port for sending and receiving IR signals. Among others, this port could have been used to communicate with other GBAs, or older CGB models, or TV Remote Controls, etc.

\[ THE INFRARED COMMUNICATION FEATURE IS -NOT- SUPPORTED ANYMORE \]
Anyways, the prototype specifications have been as shown below\...

Keep in mind that the IR signal may be interrupted by whatever objects moved between sender and receiver - the IR port isn\'t recommended for programs that require realtime data exchange (such like action games).

When IRQ is enabled, an interrupt is requested if the incoming signal was 0.119us Off (2 cycles), followed by 0.536us On (9 cycles) - minimum timing periods each.

### Transmission Notes
When transmitting an IR signal, note that it\'d be not a good idea to keep the LED turned On for a very long period (such like sending a 1 second synchronization pulse). The recipient\'s circuit would treat such a long signal as \"normal IR pollution which is in the air\" after a while, and thus ignore the signal.

### Reception Notes
Received data is internally latched. Latched data may be read out by setting both READ and AMP bits.
Note: Provided that you don\'t want to receive your own IR signal, be sure to set Bit 0 to zero before attempting to receive data.

### Power-consumption
After using the IR port, be sure to reset the register to zero in order to reduce battery power consumption.
