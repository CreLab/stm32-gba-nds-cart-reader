# GBA Sound Controller


The GBA supplies four \'analogue\' sound channels for Tone and Nois
(mostly compatible to CGB sound), as well as two \'digital\' soun
channels (which can be used to replay 8bit DMA sample data).

- [GBA Sound Channel 1 - Tone & Sweep](./gbasoundchannel1tonesweep.md)
- [GBA Sound Channel 2 - Tone](./gbasoundchannel2tone.md)
- [GBA Sound Channel 3 - Wave Output](./gbasoundchannel3waveoutput.md)
- [GBA Sound Channel 4 - Noise](./gbasoundchannel4noise.md)
- [GBA Sound Channel A and B - DMA Sound](./gbasoundchannelaandbdmasound.md)

- [GBA Sound Control Registers](./gbasoundcontrolregisters.md)
- [GBA Comparison of CGB and GBA Sound](./gbacomparisonofcgbandgbasound.md)

The GBA includes only a single (mono) speaker built-in, each channel may
be output to either left and/or right channels by using the external
line-out connector (for stereo headphones, etc).
