Write a \'1\' to a bit to clear it. For the Half-Overflow flags tha
works ONLY if the counter MSBs are zero (ie. one must first read the
counters (to reset them), and THEN acknowledge the corresponding W_IF
bit).
The Transmit Start/Complete bits (Bit7,1) are set for EACH packet
(including beacons, and including retries).

**4808012h - W_IE - Wifi Interrupt Enable Flags (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-15  Enable Flags, same bits as W_IF  (0=Disable, 1=Enable)    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

In W_IE, Bit10 is R/W, but seems to have no function since IRQ10
doesn\'t exist.

**480821Ch - W_IF_SET (W_INTERNAL) - Force Wifi Interrupt Flags (W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-15  Set corresponding bits in W_IF  (0=No change, 1=Set Bit)  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Notes: Bit10 cannot be set since no IRQ10 exists. This register does
only set IRQ flags, but without performing special actions (such like
W_BEACON_COUNT and W_POST_BEACON reloads that occur on real IRQ14\'s).

**Wifi Primary IRQ Flag (IF.Bit24, Port 4000214h)**
IF.Bit24 gets set \<only\> when (W_IF AND W_IE) changes from 0000h t
non-zero.
IF.Bit24 can be reset (ack) \<even\> when (W_IF AND W_IE) is stil
non-zero.

|    That means, when acknowledging IF.Bit24, then NO FURTHER wifi IRQs |
|                                                                       |
|   will be executed whilst and as long as (W_IF AND W_IE) is non-zero. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

One work-around is to process/acknowledge ALL wifi IRQs in a loop,
including further IRQs that may occur inside of that loop, until (W_IF
AND W_IE) becomes 0000h.
Another work-around (for single IRQs) would be to acknowledge IF and
W_IF, and then to set W_IE temporarily to 0000h, and then back to the
old W_IE setting.
