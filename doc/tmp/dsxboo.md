# DS Xboo


The DS Xboo cable allows to upload NDS ROM-Images (max 3.9MBytes) to the
console via parallel port connection. Should be the best, simpliest,
easiest, and fastest way to test code on real hardware. And, at a
relative decent price of 11 cents per diode it should be by far the
least expensive way. You\'ll have to touch classic tools (screwdrivers
knifes, saws, tweezers, and solder) which will probably scare most of
you to hell.

Parts List: 15 wires, four (DS) or twelve (DS-Lite) \"BAT 85\" diodes, 
parallel port socket.

**DS XBOO Connection Notes**
The Firmware chip (FMW.Pins) hides underneath of the RFU shielding
plate, so it\'d be easier to connect the wires to the RFU.Pins (excep
DS-Lite: The RFU pins are terribly small (and have different
pin-numbers), so either using FMW.Pins, or using mainboard vias (see
below GIF) would be easier). The easiest way for the /W-to-VCC
connection is to shortcut SL1 by putting some solder onto it.
The P00..P07 and INT signals are labeled on the switch-side of the
mainboard, however, there should be more room for the cables when
connecting them to via\'s at the bottom-side (except DS-Lite: P01 i
found only at switch-side) image below may help to locate that pins,

At the parallel port side, DSUB.Pins or CNTR.Pins can be used for 25pin
DSUB or 36pin Centronics sockets, the latter one allowing to use a
standard printer cable.
The ring printed on the diodes is pointing towards parallel port side,
the 4 diodes are required to prevent the parallel port to pull-up LOW
levels on the NDS side, be sure to use BAT85 diodes, cheaper ones like
1N4148 are loosing too much voltage and won\'t gain stable LOW levels.
The power managment chip in the DS-Lite simply refuses to react to the
Power-On button when P00..P07 are dragged high by the parallel port
(even if it is in HighZ state), the 8 diodes in the data-lines are
solving that problem (they are required on DS-Lite only, not on original
DS).

**DS XBOO Operation Notes**
The main Upload function is found in no\$gba Utility menu, together wit
further functions in Remote Access sub-menu.
Before uploading anything: download the original firmware, the file is
saved as FIRMnnnn.BIN, whereas \"nnnn\" is equal to the last 16bit o
the consoles 48bit MAC address, so Firmware-images from different
consoles are having unique filenames. If you don\'t already have, als
download the NDS BIOS, the BIOS contains encryption seed data required
to encrypt/decrypt secure area; without having downloaded the BIOS,
no\$gba will be working only with unencrypted ROM-images. Next, selec
Patch Firmware to install the nocash firmware.

**DS XBOO Troubleshooting**
Be sure that the console is switched on, and that the XBOO cable is
connected, and that you have selected the correct parallel port in
no\$gba setup (the \"multiboot\" options in Various Options screen)
and, of course, try avoid to be fiddling with the joypad during
uploads.
I\'ve tested the cable on two computers, the overall upload/downloa
stuff should work stable. The firmware access functions - which are
required only for (un-)installation - worked only with one of the two
computers; try using a different computer/parallel port in case of
problems.

**Nocash Firmware**
The primary purpose is to receive uploaded NDS-images via parallel port
connection, additionally it\'s containing bootmenu and setup screen
similar to the original firmware. The user interface is having less
cryptic symbols and should be alltogether faster and easier to use.
Important Information about Whatever is supported (but it can be
disabled). The setup contains a couple of additional options like
automatic daylight saving time adjustment.
The bootmenu allows to boot normal NDS and GBA carts, it does
additionally allow to boot NDS-images (or older PassMe-images) from
flashcards in GBA slot. Furthermore, benefits of asm coding, the nocash
firmware occupies less than 32KBytes, allowing to store (and boot)
smaller NDS-images in the unused portion of the firmware memory (about
224KBytes), the zero-filled region between cart header and secure area,
at 200h..3FFFh, is automatically excluded, so the image may be slightly
bigger than the available free memory space.

**Missing**
Unlike the original firmware, the current version cannot yet boot via
WLAN.
