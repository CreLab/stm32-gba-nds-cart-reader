# DS Xboo


The DS Xboo cable allows to upload NDS ROM-Images (max 3.9MBytes) to the console via parallel port connection. Should be the best, simpliest, easiest, and fastest way to test code on real hardware. And, at a relative decent price of 11 cents per diode it should be by far the least expensive way. You\'ll have to touch classic tools (screwdrivers, knifes, saws, tweezers, and solder) which will probably scare most of you to hell.

Parts List: 15 wires, four (DS) or twelve (DS-Lite) \"BAT 85\" diodes, 1 parallel port socket.

### DS XBOO Connection Notes
The Firmware chip (FMW.Pins) hides underneath of the RFU shielding plate, so it\'d be easier to connect the wires to the RFU.Pins (except DS-Lite: The RFU pins are terribly small (and have different pin-numbers), so either using FMW.Pins, or using mainboard vias (see below GIF) would be easier). The easiest way for the /W-to-VCC connection is to shortcut SL1 by putting some solder onto it.
The P00..P07 and INT signals are labeled on the switch-side of the mainboard, however, there should be more room for the cables when connecting them to via\'s at the bottom-side (except DS-Lite: P01 is found only at switch-side) image below may help to locate that pins,

At the parallel port side, DSUB.Pins or CNTR.Pins can be used for 25pin DSUB or 36pin Centronics sockets, the latter one allowing to use a standard printer cable.
The ring printed on the diodes is pointing towards parallel port side, the 4 diodes are required to prevent the parallel port to pull-up LOW levels on the NDS side, be sure to use BAT85 diodes, cheaper ones like 1N4148 are loosing too much voltage and won\'t gain stable LOW levels.
The power managment chip in the DS-Lite simply refuses to react to the Power-On button when P00..P07 are dragged high by the parallel port (even if it is in HighZ state), the 8 diodes in the data-lines are solving that problem (they are required on DS-Lite only, not on original DS).

### DS XBOO Operation Notes
The main Upload function is found in no\$gba Utility menu, together with further functions in Remote Access sub-menu.
Before uploading anything: download the original firmware, the file is saved as FIRMnnnn.BIN, whereas \"nnnn\" is equal to the last 16bit of the consoles 48bit MAC address, so Firmware-images from different consoles are having unique filenames. If you don\'t already have, also download the NDS BIOS, the BIOS contains encryption seed data required to encrypt/decrypt secure area; without having downloaded the BIOS, no\$gba will be working only with unencrypted ROM-images. Next, select Patch Firmware to install the nocash firmware.

### DS XBOO Troubleshooting
Be sure that the console is switched on, and that the XBOO cable is connected, and that you have selected the correct parallel port in no\$gba setup (the \"multiboot\" options in Various Options screen), and, of course, try avoid to be fiddling with the joypad during uploads.
I\'ve tested the cable on two computers, the overall upload/download stuff should work stable. The firmware access functions - which are required only for (un-)installation - worked only with one of the two computers; try using a different computer/parallel port in case of problems.

### Nocash Firmware
The primary purpose is to receive uploaded NDS-images via parallel port connection, additionally it\'s containing bootmenu and setup screens similar to the original firmware. The user interface is having less cryptic symbols and should be alltogether faster and easier to use. Important Information about Whatever is supported (but it can be disabled). The setup contains a couple of additional options like automatic daylight saving time adjustment.
The bootmenu allows to boot normal NDS and GBA carts, it does additionally allow to boot NDS-images (or older PassMe-images) from flashcards in GBA slot. Furthermore, benefits of asm coding, the nocash firmware occupies less than 32KBytes, allowing to store (and boot) smaller NDS-images in the unused portion of the firmware memory (about 224KBytes), the zero-filled region between cart header and secure area, at 200h..3FFFh, is automatically excluded, so the image may be slightly bigger than the available free memory space.

### Missing
Unlike the original firmware, the current version cannot yet boot via WLAN.
