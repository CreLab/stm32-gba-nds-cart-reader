The ARM registers are similar (but not identical) as for DSi cameras,
- [DSi Cameras](./dsicameras.md)
The I2C bus camera init does work same as on DSi (for Aptina cameras),
- [DSi I2C Bus](./dsii2cbus.md)
Cameras must be enabled in CFG11_CAMERA_CNT (Port 10141224h).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Caution: There will be no further data received after overrun. To avoid
overrun, be sure to read data fast enough, and disable CAM_CNT.bit15
after reading the camera bitmap.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unknown, bit0-5 seems to have no direct effect on the camera picture.
Maybe selects timings or amount of words for DMA requests? Or maybe some
bits resemble DSi\'s CAM_MCNT register?

**1012x010h - CAM_SOFS alike DSi cameras (0..01FF03FEh) (R/W)**

Looks same as on DSi, but the settings seem to have no effect on 3DS,
ie. there appears to be no way to enable the trimming feature?

**1032x000h..1032x07Fh - CAM_DAT - Data FIFO (20h words window) (R)**
The FIFO read window is 20h words in size (the actual FIFO is bigger;
about 500h or A00h words?). The (default) data format is same as the
YUV422 format for DSi cameras:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|     0-7   First Pixel Luminance (Y)   (unsigned, 00h..FFh, FFh=white) |
|                                                                       |
|      8-15  Both Pixels Blue (Cb aka U) (unsigned, 00h..FFh, 80h=gray) |
|                                                                       |
|     16-23 Second Pixel Luminance (Y)  (unsigned, 00h..FFh, FFh=white) |
|                                                                       |
|      24-31 Both Pixels Red (Cr aka V)  (unsigned, 00h..FFh, 80h=gray) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Caution: It is important to read words from INCREASING addresses at
1032x000h..1032x07Fh (or at least toggle address bit2 after each read)
(trying to read words from FIXED address 1032x000h will return the same
word endless repeated).

**Camera Notes**
The \"camera in-use\" LED for external camera is controlled via MCU (bu
the LED exists on DSi/3DS only, New3DS doesn\'t have that LE
installed).
The three 3DS/New3DS cameras have the same Chip IDs (2280h) as found in
the two DSi\'s Aptina MT9V113 cameras.
However, New3DS is said to have improved picture quality. Unknown what
that means, maybe the I2C registers are simply initialized with better
gain settings at software side, or maybe the camera hardware is actually
improved despite of having the same chip id.
New3DS is also said to support eye-tracking, whatever that means, it is
probably done using the internal camera. And New3DS is said to have an
IR-LED next to the internal camera to assist eye-tracking (yet unknown
if/how the YUV/RGB camera could see IR-light at all).
