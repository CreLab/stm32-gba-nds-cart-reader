# DS 3D Matrix Examples (Projection)


The most important matrix is the Projection Matrix (to be initialized
with MTX_MODE=0 via MTX_LOAD_4x4 command). It does specify the
dimensions of the view volume.

With Perspective Projections more distant objects will appear smaller,
with Orthogonal Projects the size of the objects is always same
regardless of their distance.


```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Perspective Projection     Orthogonal Projection                |
|                        __                  __________                 |
|            top __..--''  |            top |          |                |
|               |   view   |                |   view   |                |
|       Eye ----|--------->|        Eye ----|--------->|                |
|               |__volume  |                |  volume  |                |
|          bottom  ''--..__|          bottom|__________|                |
|             near        far             near        far               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


Correctly initializing the projection matrix (as shown in the examples
below) can be quite difficult (mind that fixed point multiply/divide
requires to adjust the fixed-point width before/after calculation). For
beginners, it may be recommended to start with a simple Identity Matrix
(MTX_IDENTITY command) used as Projection Matrix (ie. Ortho with t,b,l,r
set to +/-1).

**Orthogonal Projections (Ortho)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       | (2.0)/(r-l)       0             0            0     |          |
|       |      0       (2.0)/(t-b)        0            0     |          |
|       |      0            0        (2.0)/(n-f)       0     |          |
|       | (l+r)/(l-r)  (b+t)/(b-t)   (n+f)/(n-f)      1.0    |          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

n,f specify the distance from eye to near and far clip planes. t,b,l,r
are the coordinates of near clip plane (top,bottom,left,right). For a
symmetrical view (ie. the straight-ahead view line centered in the
middle of viewport) t,b,l,r should be usually t=+ysiz/2, b=-ysiz/2,
r=+xsiz/2, l=-xsiz/2; the (xsiz/ysiz) ratio should be usually equal to
the viewport\'s (width/heigh) ratio. Examples for a asymmetrical vie
would be b=0 (frog\'s view), or t=0 (bird\'s view).

**Left-Right Asymmetrical Perspective Projections (Frustum)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       | (2*n)/(r-l)       0             0            0     |          |
|       |      0       (2*n)/(t-b)        0            0     |          |
|       | (r+l)/(r-l)  (t+b)/(t-b)   (n+f)/(n-f)     -1.0    |          |
|       |      0            0       (2*n*f)/(n-f)      0     |          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

n,f,t,b,l,r have same meanings as above (Ortho), the difference is that
more distant objects will appear smaller with Perspective Projection
(unlike Orthogonal Projection where the size isn\'t affected by th
distance).

**Left-Right Symmetrical Perspective Projections (Perspective)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       | cos/(asp*sin)     0             0            0     |          |
|       |      0         cos/sin          0            0     |          |
|       |      0            0        (n+f)/(n-f)     -1.0    |          |
|       |      0            0       (2*n*f)/(n-f)      0     |          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Quite the same as above (Frustum), but with symmetrical t,b values
(which are in this case obtained from a vertical view range specified in
degrees), and l,r are matched to the aspect ratio of the viewport
(asp=height/width).

**Moving the Camera**
After initializing the Projection Matrix, you may multiply it with
Rotate and/or Translation Matrices to change camera\'s position and vie
direction.
