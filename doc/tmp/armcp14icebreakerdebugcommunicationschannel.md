# ARM CP14 ICEbreaker Debug Communications Channel


The ICEbreaker aka EmbeddedICE module may be found in ARM7TDMI and possibly also in other ARM processors. The main functionality of the module relies on external inputs (BREAKPT signal, etc.) being controlled by external debugging hardware. At software side, ICEbreaker contains a Debug Communications Channel (again to access external hardware), which can be accessed as coprocessor 14 via following opcodes:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       MRC{cond} P14,0,Rd,C0,C0,0  ;Read Debug Comms Control Register  |
|       MRC{cond} P14,0,Rd,C1,C0,0  ;Read Debug Comms Data Register     |
|       MRC{cond} P14,0,Rd,C2,C0,0  ;Read Debug Comms Status Register   |
|       MCR{cond} P14,0,Rd,C1,C0,0  ;Write Debug Comms Data Register    |
|       MCR{cond} P14,0,Rd,C2,C0,0  ;Write Debug Comms Status Register  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Control register consists of Bit31-28=ICEbreaker version (0001b for ARM7TDMI), Bit27-2=Not specified, Bit0/Bit1=Data Read/Write Status Flags.

The NDS7 and GBA allow to access CP14 (unlike as for CP0..CP13 & CP15, access to CP14 doesn\'t generate any exceptions), however, the ICEbreaker module appears to be disabled (or completely unimplemented), any reads from P14,0,Rd,C0,C0,0 through P14,7,Rd,C15,C15,7 are simply returning the prefetched opcode value from \[\$+8\]. ICEbreaker might be eventually used and enabled in Nintendo\'s hardware debuggers, although external breakpoints are reportedly implemented via /FIQ input rather than via ICEbreaker hardware.
The NDS9 doesn\'t include a CP14 unit (or it is fully disabled), any attempts to access it are causing invalid instruction exceptions.
