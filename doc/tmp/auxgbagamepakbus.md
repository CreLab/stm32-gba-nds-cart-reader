# AUX GBA Game Pak Bus


**Game Pak Bus - 32pin cartridge slot**
The cartridge bus may be used for both CGB and GBA game paks. In GBA
mode, it is used as follows:

When accessing game pak SRAM, a 16bit address is output through
AD0-AD15, then 8bit of data are transferred through A16-A23.
When accessing game pak ROM, a 24bit address is output through AD0-AD15
and A16-A23, then 16bit of data are transferred through AD0-AD15.
The 24bit address is formed from the actual 25bit memory address
(byte-steps), divided by two (halfword-steps).
Pin Pitch is 1.5mm.

**8bit-Gamepak-Switch (GBA, GBA SP only) (not DS)**
A small switch is located inside of the cartridge slot, the switch is
pushed down when an 8bit cartridge is inserted, it is released when a
GBA cartridge is inserted (or if no cartridge is inserted).
The switch mechanically controls whether VDD3 or VDD5 are output at
VDD35; ie. in GBA mode 3V power supply/signals are used for the
cartridge slot and link port, while in 8bit mode 5V are used.
The switch additionally drags IN35 to 3V when an 8bit cart is inserted,
the current state of IN35 can be determined in GBA mode via Port
4000204h (WAITCNT), if the switch is pushed, then CGB mode can be
activated via Port 4000000h (DISPCNT.3), this bit can be set ONLY by
opcodes in BIOS region (eg. via CpuSet SWI function).
In 8bit mode, the cartridge bus works much like for GBA SRAM, however,
the 8bit /CS signal is expected at Pin 5, while GBA SRAM /CS2 at Pin 30
is interpreted as /RESET signal by the 8bit MBC chip (if any). In
practice, this appears to result in 00h being received as data when
attempting to read-out 8bit cartridges from inside of GBA mode.
