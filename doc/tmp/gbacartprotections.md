# GBA Cart Protections


### Classic NES Series
These are some NES/Famicom games ported or emulated to work on GBA. The games are doing some uncommon stuff that can cause compatibility problems when not using original GBA consoles or cartridges.
- CPU pipeline (selfmodifying code that shall NOT affect prefetched opcodes)
- STMDA write to I/O ports (writes in INCREASING order, not DECREASING order)
- SRAM detection (refuses to run if SRAM exists; the games do contain EEPROM)
- ROM mirrors (instead of the usual increasing numbers in unused ROM area)
- RAM mirrors (eg. main RAM accessed at 2F00000h instead of 2000000h)
Note: These games can be detected by checking \[80000ACh\]=\"F\" (ie. game code=\"Fxxx\").
