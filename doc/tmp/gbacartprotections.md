# GBA Cart Protections


**Classic NES Series**
These are some NES/Famicom games ported or emulated to work on GBA. The
games are doing some uncommon stuff that can cause compatibility
problems when not using original GBA consoles or cartridges.
- CPU pipeline (selfmodifying code that shall NOT affect prefetched
opcodes)
- STMDA write to I/O ports (writes in INCREASING order, not DECREASING
order)
- SRAM detection (refuses to run if SRAM exists; the games do contain
EEPROM)
- ROM mirrors (instead of the usual increasing numbers in unused ROM
area)
- RAM mirrors (eg. main RAM accessed at 2F00000h instead of 2000000h)
- Note: These games can be detected by checking \[80000ACh\]=\"F\" (ie
game code=\"Fxxx\").
