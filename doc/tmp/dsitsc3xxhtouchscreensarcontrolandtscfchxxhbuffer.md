host-controlled mode, it is valid only for (X/Y) or (X/Y/Z1/Z2)

- The timings marked \"(when TSC\[3:10h\] set to 1MHz)\" are assuming th
MCLK division result to be 1MHz (1us). Other divider settings will cause
those timings to change. Using Internal Osc/8 (Bit7=0) results in
1.025MHz (0.97us), which is almost same as the \"1MHz\" timing
(internal osc isn\'t too accurate though).
Bit7: External clock is used only to control the delay programmed
between the conversions and not used for doing the actual conversion.
This is supported to get an accurate delay, because the internal
oscillator frequency varies from device to device.
