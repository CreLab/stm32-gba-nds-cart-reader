# GBA System Control


**4000204h - WAITCNT - Waitstate Control (R/W)**
This register is used to configure game pak access timings. The game pak
ROM is mirrored to three address regions at 08000000h, 0A000000h, and
0C000000h, these areas are called Wait State 0-2. Different access
timings may be assigned to each area (this might be useful in case that
a game pak contains several ROM chips with different access times
each).

At startup, the default setting is 0000h. Currently manufactured
cartridges are using the following settings: WS0/ROM=3,1 clks; SRAM=8
clks; WS2/EEPROM: 8,8 clks; prefetch enabled; that is, WAITCNT=4317h,
for more info see \"GBA Cartridges\" chapter.

First Access (Non-sequential) and Second Access (Sequential) define the
waitstates for N and S cycles, the actual access time is 1 clock cycle
PLUS the number of waitstates.
GamePak uses 16bit data bus, so that a 32bit access is split into TWO
16bit accesses (of which, the second fragment is always sequential, even
if the first fragment was non-sequential).

- [GBA GamePak Prefetch](./gbagamepakprefetch.md)

NOTES:
The GBA forcefully uses non-sequential timing at the beginning of each
- 128K-block of gamepak ROM, eg. \"LDMIA \[801fff8h\],r0-r7\" will hav
non-sequential timing at 8020000h.
The PHI Terminal output (PHI Pin of Gamepak Bus) should be disabled.

**4000300h - POSTFLG - BYTE - Undocumented - Post Boot / Debug Control
(R/W)**
After initial reset, the GBA BIOS initializes the register to 01h, and
any further execution of the Reset vector (00000000h) will pass control
to the Debug vector (0000001Ch) when sensing the register to be still
set to 01h.

```

```

Normally the debug handler rejects control unless it detects Debug flags
in cartridge header, in that case it may redirect to a cut-down boot
procedure (bypassing Nintendo logo and boot delays, much like nocash
burst boot for multiboot software). I am not sure if it is possible to
reset the GBA externally without automatically resetting register 300h
though.

**4000301h - HALTCNT - BYTE - Undocumented - Low Power Mode Control
(W)**
Writing to this register switches the GBA into battery saving mode.
In Halt mode, the CPU is paused as long as (IE AND IF)=0, this should be
used to reduce power-consumption during periods when the CPU is waiting
for interrupt events.
In Stop mode, most of the hardware including sound and video are paused,
this very-low-power mode could be used much like a screensaver.

```

The current GBA BIOS addresses only the upper eight bits of this
register (by writing 00h or 80h to address 04000301h), however, as the
register isn\'t officially documented, some or all of the bits migh
have different meanings in future GBA models.
For best forwards compatibility, it\'d generally be more recommended t
use the BIOS Functions SWI 2 (Halt) or SWI 3 (Stop) rather than writing
to this register directly.

**4000410h - Undocumented - Purpose Unknown ? 8bit (W)**
The BIOS writes the 8bit value 0FFh to this address. Purpose Unknown.
Probably just another bug in the BIOS.

**4000800h - 32bit - Undocumented - Internal Memory Control (R/W)**
Supported by GBA and GBA SP only - NOT supported by DS (even in GBA
mode).
Also supported by GBA Micro - but crashes on \"overclocked\" WRA
setting.
Initialized to 0D000020h (by hardware). Unlike all other I/O registers,
this register is mirrored across the whole I/O area (in increments of
64K, ie. at 4000800h, 4010800h, 4020800h, \..., 4FF0800h)

```

The default value 0Dh in Bits 24-27 selects 2 waitstates for 256K WRAM
(ie. 3/3/6 cycles 8/16/32bit accesses). The fastest possible setting
would be 0Eh (1 waitstate, 2/2/4 cycles for 8/16/32bit), that works on
GBA and GBA SP only, the GBA Micro locks up with that setting (it\'
on-chip RAM is too slow, and works only with 2 or more waitstates).

Note: One cycle equals approx. 59.59ns (ie. 16.78MHz clock).
