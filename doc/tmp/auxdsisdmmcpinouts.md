# AUX DSi SD/MMC Pin-Outs


**SD/MMC Transfer Modes**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Transfer Modes        SPI-Mode    1-bit-Bus  4-bit-Bus   SDIO   |
|       MMC Cards             Optional    Yes        MMCplus     No     |

|     SD Cards              Yes         Yes        Optional??  Optional |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: SDIO is an extension to the SD protocol, allowing to access other
non-memory-card hardware (such like cameras or network adaptors) via SD
connectors.
Note: Original MMC cards don\'t support 4-bit bus, but there ar
revisions like MMCplus and MMCmobile (with extra pin rows) which do
support 4-bit and 8bit bus.

```

Moreover, the card sockets (not the cards themselves) are usually
containing a Card Detect switch, and, for SD card sockets, also a write
protect switch:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       --                                                              |
|   --      CD  CD     CD      Card Detect (senses if card is inserted) |
|       --   -                                                          |
| --     WP  --     --      Write Protect (senses position of LOCK tab) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note that the LOCK tab on SD cards is just a small piece of plastic
without any electronics attached to it, the actual switch/sensor is
located in the SD card socket (ie. the LOCK works much like the
write-protect tabs on audio tapes, video tapes, and floppy discs).
Card detect can be an actual switch (however, some sockets are simply
having dual contacts for Pin 3 (GND), one being GND, and the other
becoming GNDed when a cartridge is inserted).

**SD/MMC Signals for on-board eMMC chip on DSi Mainboard
\"C/TWL-CPU-01\"**
Below are the required eMMC signals. Low-end hardware may get away with
using Data0 as single data line (eg. small microprocessors with few I/O
pins), but higher quality hardware should support 4bit data mode (eg.
off-the-shelve SD card interfaces may insist on all four data lines
being connected). Data3 (aka CardDetect) might be also needed even in
1bit data mode.

The KMAPF0000M chip does probably NOT support SPI mode, and it does
probably support only MMC protocol (not SD protocol). That, assuming
that the chip does have similar capabilities as in KMCEN0000M datasheet
(there\'s no KMAPF0000M datasheet online).

**SD/MMC Signals and 3DS Hardmodding**
Pictures with eMMC solder pads for 3DS mainboards boards can be found
at:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/Hardware                            |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

However, hardmodding is much more difficult for 3DS as than for DSi.
Three 3DS-specific problems:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| 3DS tends to hold CLK low, and there is no resistor installed between |
|       3DS                                                             |
| CPU and eMMC chip, so the card reader may be unable to pull CLK high. |

|       solde                                                           |
| r pads just for that purpose) (330..660 ohms have worked for me, I am |
|       curren                                                          |

| rd reader, and much larger resistors won't work with the 3DS itself). |

**Soldering Notes**
Connect CLK/CMD to the pins on right side of R113/R94 (as shown in the
drawing). Connect Data3/0/1/2 to the LOWER pins of RA4 (unlike as shown
in the drawing, ie. NOT to the upper pins), or alternately, connect them
to the four vias below of RA4. Connect GND somewhere to shielding plate,
for example.
My own setup is: A 8pin ribbon cable soldered to a spare SD-to-SDmicro
adapter (used as connector for SD/MMC slots), the ribbon cable is wired
to a small circuit board, which is soldered to the shielding of the
DSi\'s game cartridge slot (just for mechanical stability). Next, som
fragile wires are forwarded from the circuit board to the actual
mainboard pins.

**Software Notes**
Remove the DSi wifiboard (not absolutely required, but doing so will
hang the DSi before accessing the eMMC, which ensures that the eMMC
won\'t be accessed simultaneously by the DSi and PC). Switch on the DSi
Connect it to SD/MMC card reader. Under Windows, the eMMC should show up
as MMC-storagedevice in Windows Explorer (alongsides with your HDD
drives), due to the encryption it isn\'t possible to access th
filesystem or logical partitions of the chip. However, the physical
sectors can be accessed.
For example, using HxD hex editor: Click Extras, Open Disk, and select
the MMC (in HxD it shows up under Physical Discs: as Removeable Disk).
Click Edit, Select All, Copy. Click File, New. Then Edit, Paste. And
finally File, Save As for saving an image of the whole 240MByte FLASH
chip.
I\'ve tried accessing the eMMC on two PCs, one worked, the othe
didn\'t:

| in98 with External Card reader: Windows didn't recognize the MMC chip |
|       Win                                                             |
| 7  with External Card reader: Okay (recognized as "unformatted" disk) |
|       Win                                                             |
| 7  with Internal Card reader: Okay (recognized as "unformatted" disk) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For testing the Operating System/Card Reader side: Connect a normal SD
card to the card reader. If HxD is showing it as both Logical Disc and
Physical Disc, then you are fine. If it shows up as Logical Disc only,
then your setup won\'t work for accessing the eMMC chip.
