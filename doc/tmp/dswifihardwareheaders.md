# DS Wifi Hardware Headers


**Hardware TX Header (12 bytes) (TXHDR)**
The TX header immediately precedes the data to be sent, and should be
put at the location that will be given to the register activating a
transmission.

```

The eight \"Don\'t care\" bytes should be usually set to zero (althoug
- setting them to FFh seems to be working as well). Entries \[00h\] an
- \[05h\] are modified by hardware, all other entries are kept unchanged.

Important note! TX length includes the length of a 4-byte \"FCS\
(checksum) for the packet. The hardware generates the FCS for you, but
you still must include it in the packet length. Also note that if the
802.11 WEP enabled bit is set in the header, the packet will be
automatically encrypted via the wep algorithm - however, the software is
responsible for providing the 4-byte IV block with the WEP key ID and
the 24bit IV value. - ALSO, you must include the length of the
\*encrypted\* FCS used in packets that have wep enabled (increase the t
length by another 4 bytes) - this value is calculated automaticly for
you, but you are responsible for including it in the length of your
packet (if you have data there, it\'ll be replaced by the FCS.)

**Hardware RX Header (12 bytes) (RXHDR)**
The RX header is an informational structure that provides needed
information about a received packet. It is written right before the
received packet data in the rx circular buffer.

```

Important Note: Received frame lengths are always multiples of 4 bytes.
While the actual header length + received frame length may be less, when
incrementing the read cursor you must pad the length to a multiple of 4
bytes.

**IEEE Header**
The above Hardware headers should (must) be followed by valid IEEE
headers. Although that headers are to be generated by software, the
hardware does do some interaction with the IEEE headers, such like
comparing address fields with W_MACADDR and W_BSSID. And, it does modify
some entries of it:
1) The sequence control value is replaced by W_TX_SEQNO\*10h (whe
enabled in W_TXBUF_LOCn.Bit13), this replacement does also overwrite the
local TXBUF value.
2) The frame control value is modified, namely, the hardware tends to
set Bit12 of it. This replacement does NOT modify the local TXBUF, but
the remote RXBUF will receive the modified value. Also, Bit0-1 (protocol
version) are forcefully set to 0.
3) Transmits via W_TXBUF_BEACON do additionally modify the 64bit
timestamp (so W_TXBUF_BEACON should be used ONLY for packets WITH
timestamp, ie. Beacons or Probe-Responses). The local TXBUF seems to be
left unchanged, but the remote RXBUF will contain the (sender\'s
W_US_COUNT value.
C) For Control Frames, the hardware headers Length value is transferred
as normally (ie. excluding the FCS length, remote RXBUF will contain
TXBUF length minus 4), but - no matter of that length value - only 10 or
16 bytes (depending on the subtype) of the IEEE frame are actually
transferred and/or stored in RXBUF.
X) For Control Frames with Subtype 0Ah, the AID entry is set to C000h,
that, probably ORed with original value in WifiRAM, or with the
W_AID_FULL register?
XX) No idea if it\'s possible to send Control Frames with subtyp
0Bh..0Fh, as for now, it seems that either they aren\'t sent, or th
receipient is ignoring them (or processing them internally, but without
storing them in RXBUF).

**RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indicator)**
The MAX RSSI is decoded as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      ar                                                               |
| m7_xlat_rssi_r0:  ;bit0=unused, bit1=extraflag, bit2-7=unsigned value |
|       tst     r0,2h           ;bit1                                   |

| r0,r0,asr 2h    ;div4 (sign bits in bit31-8 are always zero-expanded) |
|                                                                       |
|     addeq   r0,r0,19h       ;add extra constant... when bit1=0 !!!!!! |
|       and     r0,r0,0FFh      ;blah (max is FFh/4+19h)                |
|       bx      r14                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The MIN RSSI value is unknown and not used by existing software (it\'
usually smaller than the 8bit MAX RSSI value, though that value is
actually 6bit+1bit, so it\'s hard to say what is bigger/smaller)
actually MIN RSSI might be something different like SNR (Signal to Noise
Ratio).
