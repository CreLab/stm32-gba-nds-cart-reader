# 3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF - Checksums


### AES CMAC
The AES CMAC is located at the beginning of the DISA / DIFF image, and it is 10h long. The rest F0h bytes before the header are unused.
The key used for the AES CMAC is generated by the hardware key engine.
The data being authenticated by the AES CMAC is a 20h-byte SHA-256 hash of a data block.

Note: The AES keyslots are known (shown above), but the AES IV appears to be unknown?

### IVFC tree
The IVFC tree is used for data verification. It is very similar to the IVFC tree in RomFS, except that it has an additional level here. For level 4, 5 and 6, each level is a list of SHA-256 hash, of which each corresponds to a block of the next level which is zero-padded to align the block size (the block size of the next level is defined in the IVFC descriptor).

The partition master hash in the partition descriptor can be seen as IVFC level 0, which hashes level 4 following the same rule. The master hash is usually 20h long, consisting only one hash. This is because most DISA / DIFF files are not large enough to have multiple hashes on the top level, which isn\'t the case for some title database files.

However, not all data is hashed - only ranges that have been written with valid data are properly hashed.

Level 7 is the actual content of the partition, which is what the container format essentially contains.

### IVFC Chain of trust
AES CMAC verifies the header.
The header verifies the active partition table via the table hash.
In the partition table, each descriptor verifies level 4 of its IVFC tree via the master hash.
Each IVFC level verifies the next level, until the level 7, which is the inner content (eg. the SAVE file system).
