Camera LED exists only in older 3DS, not in New3DS. The camera LED uses
a digital 1bit signal (without variable brightness).

- |       01h = 3D LED On  (or fade-in/out to MCU[28h] setting)           |
|       02h..0Fh = Same as 01h (On)                                     |

\"It\'s possible to write data here with size less than 64h, and onl
that portion of the pattern data will get overwritten. Writing past the
size of this register seems to do nothing. Reading from this register
only returns zeroes.\"

- **MCU\[2Eh\] - Notification LED Status when read (1=new cycle started
(R)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     Flag                                                      |

**Initial LED States**
The LED states are uninitialzed at warmboot (eg. after closing System
Settings, firm0 may boot with 3D LED kept on). All LEDs are
automatically fading to zero upon power off (for faster power-off, use
- MCU\[29h\]=4 before MCU\[20h\]=1). At coldboot, firm0 is started wit
only Power LED switched on.
Regardless of the above, the Charge LED can be on/off at any time (it is
on when battery isn\'t fully charged & charger is connected).
