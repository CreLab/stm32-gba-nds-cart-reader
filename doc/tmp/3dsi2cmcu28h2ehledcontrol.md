Camera LED exists only in older 3DS, not in New3DS. The camera LED uses a digital 1bit signal (without variable brightness).

### MCU\[2Ch\] - 3D LED state, 4 bits wide (R/W)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h = 3D LED Off (or fade-out to zero)                          |
|       01h = 3D LED On  (or fade-in/out to MCU[28h] setting)           |
|       02h..0Fh = Same as 01h (On)                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

3D LED exists only in older 3DS, not in New3DS.

### MCU\[2Dh\] - Notification LED Array (4+3x20h bytes) ;ARRAY\[64h\] (W)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

\"It\'s possible to write data here with size less than 64h, and only that portion of the pattern data will get overwritten. Writing past the size of this register seems to do nothing. Reading from this register only returns zeroes.\"

### MCU\[2Eh\] - Notification LED Status when read (1=new cycle started) (R)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     Flag                                                      |
|       1-7   Not used                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Initial LED States
The LED states are uninitialzed at warmboot (eg. after closing System Settings, firm0 may boot with 3D LED kept on). All LEDs are automatically fading to zero upon power off (for faster power-off, use MCU\[29h\]=4 before MCU\[20h\]=1). At coldboot, firm0 is started with only Power LED switched on.
Regardless of the above, the Charge LED can be on/off at any time (it is on when battery isn\'t fully charged & charger is connected).
