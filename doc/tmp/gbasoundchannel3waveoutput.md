# GBA Sound Channel 3 - Wave Output


This channel can be used to output digital sound, the length of the sample buffer (Wave RAM) can be either 32 or 64 digits (4bit samples). This sound channel can be also used to output normal tones when initializing the Wave RAM by a square wave. This channel doesn\'t have a volume envelope register.

The currently selected Bank Number (Bit 6) will be played back, while reading/writing to/from wave RAM will address the other (not selected) bank. When dimension is set to two banks, output will start by replaying the currently selected bank.

The Length value is used only if Bit 6 in NR34 is set.

The above sample rate specifies the number of wave RAM digits per second, the actual tone frequency depends on the wave RAM content, for example:

```

|       Wave RAM, single bank 32 digits   Tone Frequency                |
|       FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF0000000000000000  65536/(2048-n) Hz             |
|       FFFFFFFF00000000FFFFFFFF00000000  131072/(2048-n) Hz            |
|       FFFF0000FFFF0000FFFF0000FFFF0000  262144/(2048-n) Hz            |
|       FF00FF00FF00FF00FF00FF00FF00FF00  524288/(2048-n) Hz            |

This area contains 16 bytes (32 x 4bits) Wave Pattern data which is output by channel 3. Data is played back ordered as follows: MSBs of 1st byte, followed by LSBs of 1st byte, followed by MSBs of 2nd byte, and so on - this results in a confusing ordering when filling Wave RAM in units of 16bit data - ie. samples would be then located in Bits 4-7, 0-3, 12-15, 8-11.

In the GBA, two Wave Patterns exists (each 32 x 4bits), either one may be played (as selected in NR30 register), the other bank may be accessed by the users. After all 32 samples have been played, output of the same bank (or other bank, as specified in NR30) will be automatically restarted.

Internally, Wave RAM is a giant shift-register, there is no pointer which is addressing the currently played digit. Instead, the entire 128 bits are shifted, and the 4 least significant bits are output.
Thus, when reading from Wave RAM, data might have changed its position. And, when writing to Wave RAM all data should be updated (it\'d be no good idea to assume that old data is still located at the same position where it has been written to previously).
