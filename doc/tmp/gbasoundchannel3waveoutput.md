# GBA Sound Channel 3 - Wave Output


This channel can be used to output digital sound, the length of the
sample buffer (Wave RAM) can be either 32 or 64 digits (4bit samples).
This sound channel can be also used to output normal tones when
initializing the Wave RAM by a square wave. This channel doesn\'t have 
volume envelope register.

The currently selected Bank Number (Bit 6) will be played back, while
reading/writing to/from wave RAM will address the other (not selected)
bank. When dimension is set to two banks, output will start by replaying
the currently selected bank.

The above sample rate specifies the number of wave RAM digits per
second, the actual tone frequency depends on the wave RAM content, for
example:

```

This area contains 16 bytes (32 x 4bits) Wave Pattern data which is
output by channel 3. Data is played back ordered as follows: MSBs of 1st
byte, followed by LSBs of 1st byte, followed by MSBs of 2nd byte, and so
on - this results in a confusing ordering when filling Wave RAM in units
of 16bit data - ie. samples would be then located in Bits 4-7, 0-3,
12-15, 8-11.

In the GBA, two Wave Patterns exists (each 32 x 4bits), either one may
be played (as selected in NR30 register), the other bank may be accessed
by the users. After all 32 samples have been played, output of the same
bank (or other bank, as specified in NR30) will be automatically
restarted.

Internally, Wave RAM is a giant shift-register, there is no pointer
which is addressing the currently played digit. Instead, the entire 128
bits are shifted, and the 4 least significant bits are output.
Thus, when reading from Wave RAM, data might have changed its position.
And, when writing to Wave RAM all data should be updated (it\'d be n
good idea to assume that old data is still located at the same position
where it has been written to previously).
