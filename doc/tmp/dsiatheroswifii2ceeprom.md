# DSi Atheros Wifi I2C EEPROM


The I2C EEPROM is read via the wifi firmware\'s bootstub (prior t
executing the main firmware) via the SI_xxx registers. The DSi wifi
boards are usually containing a HN58X2408F chip (1Kx8, with 8bit index).
However, the bootstub contains code for also supporting HN58X24xx chips
with bigger capacity (including such with 16bit index) (although
actually using only 300h bytes regardless of the capacity). The I2C
device number is A0h, or, in case of EEPROMs with 8bit index, the device
number is misused to contain the upper address bits as so:

|  = A0h + direction_flag + (addr/100h)*2  ;for devices with 8bit index |

The presence of the I2C EEPROM appears to be some mis-conception. It
might make sense to store the wifi calibration data on the daughterboard
(rather than in eMMC storage on mainboard), however, it could be as well
stored in the SPI FLASH chip, but Nintendo apparently didn\'t knew ho
to do that.
