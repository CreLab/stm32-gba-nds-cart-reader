# 3DS GPU Texture Types


### Mipmap
Mipmaps have the original texture bundled with smaller copies (with halved width/height, used for rendering more distant polygons). This may improve memory cache hits, and also improve display quality (eg. when resampling black+white pixels to gray). Mipmaps don\'t waste too much memory (orginal=100%, total=133%) (or in other terms, original=75%, total=100%).
The Mipmap could be stored as separate rectangles (as done on 3DS), or within a single rectangle:

### Cubemap (panorama)
A cubemap consists of six textures arranged as a cube, allowing to render 360\' panoramas (with the camera being located INSIDE of the cube).
