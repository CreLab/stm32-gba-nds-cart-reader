# 3DS GPU Texture Types


**Mipmap**
Mipmaps have the original texture bundled with smaller copies (with
halved width/height, used for rendering more distant polygons). This may
improve memory cache hits, and also improve display quality (eg. when
resampling black+white pixels to gray). Mipmaps don\'t waste too muc
memory (orginal=100%, total=133%) (or in other terms, original=75%,
total=100%).
The Mipmap could be stored as separate rectangles (as done on 3DS), or
within a single rectangle:

**Cubemap (panorama)**
A cubemap consists of six textures arranged as a cube, allowing to
render 360\' panoramas (with the camera being located INSIDE of th
cube).
