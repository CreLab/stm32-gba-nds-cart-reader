Specifies what packets to allow. Some random notes\...

|       0000h = Disable receive.                                        |
|       FFFFh = Enable receive.                                         |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The exact meaning of the bits is unknown. The most import part is the
address filtering based on the DA and BSSID values in IEEE header:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       DA=W_MACADDR                    is always received              |
|       DA=Broadcast, and BSSID=W_BSSID is always received              |
|                                                                       |
|   DA=Broadcast, and BSSID=other   is received only if RXFILTER.bit0=1 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Broadcast addresses (aka group addresses) have DA.firstbyte.bit0=1.
RXFILTER.bit0 should be set when searching beacons, and cleared after
connecting to an access point.

Firmware writes values 08h, 0Bh, 0Dh (aka 1000b, 1011b, 1101b).
Firmware usually has bit0 set, even when receiving data frames, so, in
some situations data frames seem to pass-through even when bit0 is
set\...? Possibly that situation is when W_BSSID matches\...?
Control/PS-Poll frames seem to be passed always (even if
W_RXFILTER2=0Fh).
