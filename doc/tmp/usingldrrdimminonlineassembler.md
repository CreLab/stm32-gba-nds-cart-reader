# Using LDR Rd,=Imm in Online Assembler


- LDR{cond} Rd,=Imm is a pseudo opcode, consisting of a LDR Rd,\[PC,disp\
- opcode, and a 32bit immediate at \[PC+disp\] in the literal pool. Th
pool is normally generated when assembling the source code, however,
additional pool values can be eventually squeezed into the final
binary:

1) If the cursor points to an existing LDR=IMM, then it can be
overwritten it by a new LDR=IMM, with changed {cond}, changed Rd, or
changed Imm. In the latter case, if the immediates pool entry is shared
with other LDR=IMMs, then the value of those opcodes will get changed as
well - if you wish to suppress that behaviour: First overwrite the old
LDR=IMM by NOP, then overwrite it again by new LDR=IMM, which will then
(try to) use below mechanisms\...

2) If the cursor does NOT point to an existing LDR=IMM, then no\$gb
will search nearby memory for usable addresses - A) a 32bit value that
matches the desired immediate, B) a word-aligned 32bit value containing
ascii letters \"fREE\", which you may want to insert here and there i
your code, or C) a presumably unused blank memory area of at least 256
bytes which is 00h- or FFh-filled.

3) If the debugged program was written in C or C++ then you can probably
replace some of the meaningless opcodes by hand. For example, to load a
16bit immediate with ARM code: MOV Rd,LSB, ADD Rd,MSB.
