In single player mode, both control sets do control the same gameboy.

The keyboard controls for player #1..#12 can be redefined in setup.
Note: The keyboard box in the DOS version wraps to the next page (for
the next player) when you move the cursor out of the box with the cursor
keys.

The other hotkeys during running emulation are:
