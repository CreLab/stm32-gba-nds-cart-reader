### 4000084h - SOUNDCNT_X (NR52) - Sound on/off (R/W)
Bits 0-3 are automatically set when starting sound output, and are automatically cleared when a sound ends. (Ie. when the length expires, as far as length is enabled. The bits are NOT reset when an volume envelope ends.)

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit        Expl.                                                     |

|       2     R    Sound 3 ON flag (Read Only)                               |
|       3     R    Sound 4 ON flag (Read Only)                               |
|       4-6   -    Not used                                                  |
|       7     R/W  PSG/FIFO Master Enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable) (Read/Write) |
|       8-31  -    Not used                                                  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

While Bit 7 is cleared, both PSG and FIFO sounds are disabled, and all PSG registers at 4000060h..4000081h are reset to zero (and must be re-initialized after re-enabling sound). However, registers 4000082h and 4000088h are kept read/write-able (of which, 4000082h has no function when sound is off, whilst 4000088h does work even when sound is off).

### 4000088h - SOUNDBIAS - Sound PWM Control (R/W, see below)
This register controls the final sound output. The default setting is 0200h, it is normally not required to change this value.

|       0     -    Not used                                                           |
|       1-9   R/W  Bias Level (Default=100h, converting signed samples into unsigned) |

|       14-15 R/W  Amplitude Resolution/Sampling Cycle (Default=0, see below)         |
|       16-31 -    Not used                                                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Amplitude Resolution/Sampling Cycle (0-3):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0  9bit / 32.768kHz   (Default, best for DMA channels A,B)      |
|       1  8bit / 65.536kHz                                             |
|       2  7bit / 131.072kHz                                            |
|       3  6bit / 262.144kHz  (Best for PSG channels 1-4)               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Bias Level has no audible effect on 3DS in GBA mode.

### 400008Ch - Not used
### 400008Eh - Not used

### Max Output Levels (with max volume settings)
Each of the two FIFOs can span the FULL output range (+/-200h).
Each of the four PSGs can span one QUARTER of the output range (+/-80h).
The current output levels of all six channels are added together by hardware.
So together, the FIFOs and PSGs, could reach THRICE the range (+/-600h).
The BIAS value is added to that signed value. With default BIAS (200h), the possible range becomes -400h..+800h, however, values that exceed the unsigned 10bit output range of 0..3FFh are clipped to MinMax(0,3FFh).

### Resampling to 32.768kHz / 9bit (default)
The PSG channels 1-4 are internally generated at 262.144kHz, and DMA sound A-B could be theoretically generated at timer rates up to 16.78MHz. However, the final sound output is resampled to a rate of 32.768kHz, at 9bit depth (the above 10bit value, divided by two). If necessary, rates higher than 32.768kHz can be selected in the SOUNDBIAS register, that would result in a depth smaller than 9bit though.

### PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) Output 16.78MHz / 1bit
Okay, now comes the actual output. The GBA can output only two voltages (low and high), these \'bits\' are output at system clock speed (16.78MHz). If using the default 32.768kHz sampling rate, then 512 bits are output per sample (512\*32K=16M). Each sample value (9bit range, N=0..511), would be then output as N low bits, followed by 512-N high bits. The resulting \'noise\' is smoothed down by capacitors, by the speaker, and by human hearing, so that it will effectively sound like clean D/A converted 9bit voltages at 32kHz sampling rate.

### Changing the BIAS Level
Normally use 200h for clean sound output. A value of 000h might make sense during periods when no sound is output (causing the PWM circuit to output low-bits only, which is eventually reducing the power consumption, and/or preventing 32KHz noise). Note: Using the SoundBias function (SWI 19h) allows to change the level by slowly incrementing or decrementing it (without hard scratch noise).

### Low Power Mode
When not using sound output, power consumption can be reduced by setting both 4000084h (PSG/FIFO) and 4000088h (BIAS) to zero.
