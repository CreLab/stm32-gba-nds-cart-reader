# GBA Unpredictable Things


**Forward**
Most of the below is caused by \'traces\' from previous operations whic
have used the databus. No promises that the results are stable on all
current or future GBA models, and/or under all temperature and
interference circumstances.
Also, below specifies 32bit data accesses only. When reading units less
than 32bit, data is rotated depending on the alignment of the originally
specified address, and 8bit or 16bit are then isolated from the 32bit
value as usually.

**Reading from BIOS Memory (00000000-00003FFF)**
The BIOS memory is protected against reading, the GBA allows to read
opcodes or data only if the program counter is located inside of the
BIOS area. If the program counter is not in the BIOS area, reading will
return the most recent successfully fetched BIOS opcode (eg. the opcode
- at \[00DCh+8\] after startup and SoftReset, the opcode at \[0134h+8\
- during IRQ execution, and opcode at \[013Ch+8\] after IRQ execution, an
- opcode at \[0188h+8\] after SWI execution).

**Reading from Unused Memory (00004000-01FFFFFF,10000000-FFFFFFFF)**
Accessing unused memory at 00004000h-01FFFFFFh, and 10000000h-FFFFFFFFh
(and 02000000h-03FFFFFFh when RAM is disabled via Port 4000800h) returns
the recently pre-fetched opcode. For ARM code this is simply:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       WORD = [$+8]                                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For THUMB code the result consists of two 16bit fragments and depends on
the address area and alignment where the opcode was stored.
For THUMB code in Main RAM, Palette Memory, VRAM, and Cartridge ROM this
is:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       LSW = [$+4], MSW = [$+4]                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For THUMB code in BIOS or OAM (and in 32K-WRAM on Original-NDS (in GBA
mode)):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- |   LSW = [$+4], MSW = [$+6]   ;for opcodes at 4-byte aligned locations |
|       LS                                                              |
- | W = [$+2], MSW = [$+4]   ;for opcodes at non-4-byte aligned locations |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For THUMB code in 32K-WRAM on GBA, GBA SP, GBA Micro, NDS-Lite (but not
NDS):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- |   LSW = [$+4], MSW = OldHI   ;for opcodes at 4-byte aligned locations |
|       LS                                                              |
- | W = OldLO, MSW = [$+4]   ;for opcodes at non-4-byte aligned locations |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Whereas OldLO/OldHI are usually:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       OldLO=[$+2], OldHI=[$+2]                                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unless the previous opcode\'s prefetch was overwritten; that can happe
if the previous opcode was itself an LDR opcode, ie. if it was itself
reading data:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       OldLO=LSW(data), OldHI=MSW(data)                                |
|       Theoretically, this might also change if a DMA transfer occurs. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: Additionally, as usually, the 32bit data value will be rotated if
the data address wasn\'t 4-byte aligned, and the upper bits of the 32bi
value will be masked in case of LDRB/LDRH reads.
Note: The opcode prefetch is caused by the prefetch pipeline in the CPU
itself, not by the external gamepak prefetch, ie. it works for code in
ROM and RAM as well.

**Reading from Unused or Write-Only I/O Ports**
Works like above Unused Memory when the entire 32bit memory fragment is
Unused (eg. 0E0h) and/or Write-Only (eg. DMA0SAD). And otherwise,
returns zero if the lower 16bit fragment is readable (eg. 04Ch=MOSAIC,
04Eh=NOTUSED/ZERO).

**Reading from GamePak ROM when no Cartridge is inserted**
Because Gamepak uses the same signal-lines for both 16bit data and for
lower 16bit halfword address, the entire gamepak ROM area is effectively
filled by incrementing 16bit values (Address/2 AND FFFFh).

**Memory Mirrors**
Most internal memory is mirrored across the whole 24bit/16MB address
space in which it is located: Slow On-board RAM at 2XXXXXX, Fast On-Chip
RAM at 3XXXXXXh, Palette RAM at 5XXXXXXh, VRAM at 6XXXXXXh, and OAM at
7XXXXXXh. Even though VRAM is sized 96K (64K+32K), it is repeated in
steps of 128K (64K+32K+32K, the two 32K blocks itself being mirrors of
each other).
BIOS ROM, Normal ROM Cartridges, and I/O area are NOT mirrored, the only
exception is the undocumented I/O port at 4000800h (repeated each 64K).
The 64K SRAM area is mirrored across the whole 32MB area at
E000000h-FFFFFFFh, also, inside of the 64K SRAM field, 32K SRAM chips
are repeated twice.

**Writing 8bit Data to Video Memory**
Video Memory (BG, OBJ, OAM, Palette) can be written to in 16bit and
32bit units only. Attempts to write 8bit data (by STRB opcode) won\'
work:
Writes to OBJ (6010000h-6017FFFh) (or 6014000h-6017FFFh in Bitmap mode)
and to OAM (7000000h-70003FFh) are ignored, the memory content remains
unchanged.
Writes to BG (6000000h-600FFFFh) (or 6000000h-6013FFFh in Bitmap mode)
and to Palette (5000000h-50003FFh) are writing the new 8bit value to
- BOTH upper and lower 8bits of the addressed halfword, ie. \"\[addr AN
NOT 1\]=data\*101h\".

**Using Invalid Tile Numbers**
In Text mode, large tile numbers (combined with a non-zero character
base setting in BGnCNT register) may exceed the available 64K of BG
VRAM.
On GBA and GBA SP, such invalid tiles are displayed as if the character
data is filled by the 16bit BG Map entry value (ie. as vertically
striped tiles). Above applies only if there is only one BG layer
enabled, with two or more layers, things are getting much more
complicated: tile-data is then somehow derived from the other layers,
depending on their priority order and scrolling offsets.
On NDS (in GBA mode), such invalid tiles are displayed as if the
character data is zero-filled (ie. as invisible/transparent tiles).

**Accessing SRAM Area by 16bit/32bit**
Reading retrieves 8bit value from specified address, multiplied by 0101h
(LDRH) or by 01010101h (LDR). Writing changes the 8bit value at the
specified address only, being set to LSB of (source_data ROR
(address\*8)).
