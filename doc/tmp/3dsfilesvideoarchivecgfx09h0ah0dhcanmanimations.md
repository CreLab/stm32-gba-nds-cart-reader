- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX_09h - CANM Skeleton animations)
- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX_0Ah - CANM Texture animations)
- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX_0Dh - CANM Light animations)
CANM skeleton is found in some CGFX files, 3DS System Settings ExeFS:\\banner
CANM texture is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Download Play ExeFS:\\banner
CANM light is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Camera RomFS:\\res\\P_Finder_U

All of those types do begin with ID \"CANM\", but unknown if they are actually using the same data structure(s).

### CANM (for Skeleton Animations, and Texture Animations)

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       N/A  -     There is no leading Flags entry,                                |
|       000h 4     ID "CANM"                                                       |
|       004h 4     Revision (05000000h)                                            |
|       008h 4     Name Offset (self-relative) eg. COMMON (same as in parent DICT) |
|       00Ch 4     Name Offset (self-relative) eg. SkeletalAnimation               |
|       010h 4     Unknown (1)                                                     |
|       014h 4     Unknown (44160000h) (float32 maybe?)                            |
|       018h 4+4   DICT for ... whatever (NumEntries,Offset)  (Offset=0Ch)         |
|       020h 4+4   Unknown (0,0)                                                   |

Note: In the above example, the name \"COMMON\" is used for both CFGX_00h and CFGX_09h and CFGX_0Ah root entries.
The DICT in the CANM block(s) can contain items with various names, the format(s) of that items are unknown.
