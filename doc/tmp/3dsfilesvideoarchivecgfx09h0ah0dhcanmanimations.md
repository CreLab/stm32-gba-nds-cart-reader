- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX_09h - CANM Skeleton animations)
- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX_0Ah - CANM Texture animations)
- 3DS Files - Video Archive (CGFX_0Dh - CANM Light animations)
CANM skeleton is found in some CGFX files, 3DS System Settings
ExeFS:\\banner
CANM texture is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Download Play
ExeFS:\\banner
CANM light is found in some CGFX files, eg. 3DS Camera
RomFS:\\res\\P_Finder_U

All of those types do begin with ID \"CANM\", but unknown if they ar
actually using the same data structure(s).

**CANM (for Skeleton Animations, and Texture Animations)**

```

Note: In the above example, the name \"COMMON\" is used for bot
CFGX_00h and CFGX_09h and CFGX_0Ah root entries.
The DICT in the CANM block(s) can contain items with various names, the
format(s) of that items are unknown.
