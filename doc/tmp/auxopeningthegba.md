# AUX Opening the GBA


Since Nintendo uses special screws with Y-shaped heads to seal the GBA
(as well as older 8bit gameboys), it\'s always a bit difficult to loose
these screws.

**Using Screwdrivers**
One possible method is to use a small flat screwdriver, which might
work, even though it\'ll most likely damage the screwdriver.
Reportedly, special Y-shaped screwdrivers for gameboys are available for
sale somewhere (probably not at your local dealer, but you might find
some in the internet or elsewhere).

**Destroying the Screws**
A more violent method is to take an electric drill, and drill-off the
screw heads, this might also slightly damage the GBA plastic chase, also
take care that the metal spoons from the destroyed screws don\'t produc
shortcuts on the GBA mainboard.

**Using a selfmade Screwdriver**
A possible method is to take a larger screw (with a normal I-shaped, or
X-shaped head), and to cut the screw-tip into Y-shape, you\'ll then en
up with an \"adapter\" which can be placed in the middle between 
normal screwdriver and gameboy screws.
Preferably, first cut the screw-tip into a shape like a \"sharp thre
sided pyramid\", next cut notches into each side. Access to 
grinding-machine will be a great benefit, but you might get it working
by using a normal metal-file as well.

**Opening the GBA Micro**
- open the case with appropriate screwdriver or drilling machine or
whatever
- remove the plastic front-plate (there are two snap-ins inside at ONE
side)
- remove the mainboard and screen and plastic skeleton from the metal
case
- remove the start/select daughter-board from the plastic skeleton
- remove the plastic skeleton (move the screen through the skeleton)
- remove the screen (lift lcd socket front-side, backlight socket
rear-side)

**Opening the NDS-Lite**
- open the case with appropriate screwdriver or drilling machine or
whatever
- remove the RFU unit, and the 4-pin touch-screen cable (under the RFU
unit)
- remove the mainboard together with the lower screen
- remove the upper/lower screen cables (on the rear-side of the
mainboard)
