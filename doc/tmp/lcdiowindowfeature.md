# LCD I/O Window Feature


The Window Feature may be used to split the screen into four regions.
The BG0-3,OBJ layers and Color Special Effects can be separately enabled
or disabled in each of these regions.

**The DISPCNT Register**
DISPCNT Bits 13-15 are used to enable Window 0, Window 1, and/or OBJ
Window regions, if any of these regions is enabled then the \"Outside o
Windows\" region is automatically enabled, too.
DISPCNT Bits 8-12 are kept used as master enable bits for the BG0-3,OBJ
layers, a layer is displayed only if both DISPCNT and WININ/OUT enable
bits are set.

**The OBJ Window**
The dimension of the OBJ Window is specified by OBJs which are having
the \"OBJ Mode\" attribute being set to \"OBJ Window\". An
non-transparent dots of any such OBJs are marked as OBJ Window area. The
OBJ itself is not displayed.
The color, palette, and display priority of these OBJs are ignored. Both
DISPCNT Bits 12 and 15 must be set when defining OBJ Window region(s).

**Window Priority**
In case that more than one window is enabled, and that these windows do
overlap, Window 0 is having highest priority, Window 1 medium, and Obj
Window lowest priority. Outside of Window is having zero priority, it is
used for all dots which are not inside of any window region.
