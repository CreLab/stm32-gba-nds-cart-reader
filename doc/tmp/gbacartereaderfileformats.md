# GBA Cart e-Reader File Formats


**.BMP Files (homebrew 300 DPI strips)**
Contains a picture of the whole dotcode strip with address bars and sync
marks (see Dotcode chapter) in Microsoft\'s Bitmap format. The image i
conventionally surrounded by a blank 2-pixel border, resulting in a size
of 989x44 pixels for long strips. The file should should have 1bit color
depth. The pixels per meter entry should match the desired printing
resolution, either 300 DPI or 360 DPI. But, resolution of printer
hardware is typically specified in inch rather than in meters, so an
exact match isn\'t supported by Microsoft. Most homebrew .BMP file
contain nonsense resolutions like 200 DPI, or 300 dots per meter (ca. 8
DPI).

**.JPG Files (scanned 1200 DPI strips)**
Same as BMP, but should contain a dotcode scanned at 1200 DPI, with
correct orientation (the card-edge side at the bottom of the image), and
containing only the dotcode (not the whole card), so the JPG size should
be about 3450x155 pixels for long strips.
No\$gba currently doesn\'t work with progressive JPGs. Scans with whit
background can be saved as monochrome JPG. Scans with red/yellow
background should contain a correct RED layer (due to the red LED light
source) (the brightness of the green/blue layers can be set to zero for
better compression).

**.RAW Files**
Contains the \"raw\" information from the BMP format, that is, 2-byt
block header, 102-byte data, 2-byte block header, 102-byte data, etc.
The data portion is interleaved, and includes the full 48-byte data
header, titles, vpk compressed data, error-info, and unused bytes. RAW
files are excluding Address Bars, Sync Marks, and 4bit-to-5bit
encoding.
Each RAW file contains one or more strip(s), so the RAW filesize is
either 18\*104 bytes (short strip), or 28\*104 bytes (long strip), or 
multiple thereof (if it contains more than one strip) (although
multi-strip games are often stored in separate files for each strip;
named file1.raw, file2.raw, etc).

**.BIN Files**
Filesize should be I\*30h, with I=1Ch for short strips, and I=2Ch fo
long strips, or a multiple thereof (if it contains more than one strip).
Each strip consists of the 48-byte Data Header, followed by title(s),
and vpk compressed data. Unlike .RAW files, .BIN files aren\'
interleaved, and do not contain Block Headers, nor error-info, nor
unused bytes (in last block). The files do contain padding bytes to
match a full strip-size of I\*30h.
Caution: Older .BIN files have been using a size-reduced 12-byte header
(taken from entries 0Dh, 0Ch, 10h-11h, 26h-2Dh of the 48-byte Data
Header; in that order), that files have never contained more than one
strip per file, so the filesize should be exactly I\*30h-36, th
size-reduced header doesn\'t contain a Primary Type entry, so it\'
everyone\'s bet which Card Type is to be used (hint: the 12-byte header
were based on the assumption that Primary Type would be always 01h on
Short Strips, and 02h on Long Strips).

**.SAV Files**
Contains a copy of the e-Reader\'s 128Kbyte FLASH memory. With the save
e-Reader application being located in the 2nd 64K-bank, the data
consists of a header with title and gba/nes/z80 format info, followed by
the vpk compressed data. The FLASH memory does also contain e-Reader
calibration settings, the remaining 100Kbytes are typically FFh-filled.
