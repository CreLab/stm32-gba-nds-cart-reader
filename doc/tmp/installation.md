# Installation


**Required Hardware**
Miminum requirement would be a 32bit CPU (eg. 80386SX and up). No\$gb
has been programmed on a 66MHz 80486DX2, smaller games (eg. simple 2D
games, text output) are working relative smoothly at 100% speed on that
computer. Larger games (eg. 3D games, plasma demos) may require a CPU
speed of up to 400..500MHz.
Emulation performance mainly depends on whether (and how much) the game
is using the low power Halt/IntrWait GBA bios functions in idle mode, or
not.

**Installing No\$gba**
Just copy the executable to harddisk, preferably into a new/blank
folder, below text will refer to this folder as the \'No\$gba\' folder
you may use any other name though. The program will automatically create
some subdirecties. For example, the Slot directory is the suggested
location for rom-images.
You will eventually also need some additional files - see below!

**Installing Updates**
Just overwrite the old executable by the newer version. The setup file
from the older version may be used, any unrecognized options will be set
to the default value.

**Uninstalling No\$gba**
The program does not infect the windows registry. If you wish to
uninstall it just delete the \'No\$gba\' folder and al
sub-directories.
Of course excluding any important files which you may have stored in
these directories and which you may want to keep (ie. source code,
binaries, game positions, and/or your registration key).

Optional Files

**NO\$GBA.ROM**
No\$gba includes a built-in BIOS clone which is used if the BIO
ROM-image(s) are not found. However, the emulation accuracy (eg. exact
execution time) of BIOS SWI-functions increases when using the original
BIOS ROM-images. BIOS images are loaded if the following file(s) exist
in your no\$gba folder.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|       NO$GBA.ROM    GBA+NDS7+NDS9 BIOS-images (16K+16K+4K)            |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Alternately, the images can be split into separate files, with
filenames:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|       BIOSNDS.ROM   NDS7+NDS9 BIOS-images (16K+4K)                    |
|       BIOSNDS7.ROM  NDS7 BIOS-image (16K)                             |
|       BIOSNDS9.ROM  NDS9 BIOS-image (4K) (or 32K padded with zero's)  |
|       BIOSGBA.ROM   GBA BIOS-image (16K)                              |
|       GBA.ROM       Same as BIOSGBA.ROM (16K)                         |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For DSi emulation,

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|       BIOSDSI                                                         |
| .ROM   DSi7+DSi9 BIOS-images (64K+64K)  ;\these are only 66% dumpable 
|       BIOS                                                            |
| DSI7.ROM  DSi7 BIOS-image (64K)            ; yet (please pad undumped |
|       BIO                                                             |
| SDSI9.ROM  DSi9 BIOS-image (64K)            ;/regions with 00h-bytes) |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

For 3DS emulation,

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|       BIOS3DS.ROM   3ds9+3ds11 BIOS-images (64K+64K) ;\               
|       BIOS                                                            |
| 3DS9.ROM  3ds9 BIOS-image (64K)            ; these are filly dumpable |
|       BIOS3DS11.ROM 3ds11 BIOS-image (64K)           ;/               |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

The no\$gba utility menu (and the Xboo tool on the no\$gba webpage
includes a function for downloading the BIOS from GBA/NDS to file (by
simple cable connection).
Be careful when downloading the BIOSes from internet, there seems to be
a very popular GBA BIOS in the net (probably a very old prototype
version), which is NOT compatible with the actual GBA release version,
also some NDS7 BIOS-images may be incomplete dumps (with first 4K
zero-filled), no\$gba outputs a warning message if using an incorrect
incomplete, damaged, or patched BIOS version.

**FIRMWARE.BIN**
A copy of the original NDS firmware in Wifi FLASH. This file increases
emulation accuracy only by means of delaying the boot process. The
no\$gba setup default setting is to start the cartridge directly
without executing the BIOS/Firmware boot code, so the presence of the
firmware image doesn\'t actually disturb emulation performance.

**DSi Firmware (onboard eMMC) and DSi External SD Card**
- [DSi SD/MMC Images](./dsisdmmcimages.md)

**PKUNZIP.EXE and/or ARJ.EXE**
These decompression programs are required when loading ARJ or ZIP
compressed cartridges. The programs must be stored in a directory which
is part of your \'Path\' (ie. a directory which is automaticall
searched by the operating system, if you do not understand this, try
using your C:\\Windows folder). Alternately, decompress the files b
hand before loading them.
