+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Stage 1**
The first stage of the DSi\'s bootloader lives in ROM, presumably on th
CPU die. It loads further encrypted (and probably signed) stages from
NAND flash, starting with a (partially unencrypted) offset table in the
sector at 0x200.
Not much is known about this bootloader yet, but it presumably knows how
to:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Initialize the encryption hardware                              |
|       Read the contents of NVRAM                                      |
|       Initialize both LCDs                                            |
|       Read blocks (but not files) from the NAND flash                 |
|       Perform                                                         |
| some variety of integrity check on all data it reads(signature,CRC,?) |
|       Display basic hexadecimal error codes                           |
|       Possibly factory-programming the NAND flash?                    |
|       Might also do basic power-on self test of peripherals           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When the Stage 1 bootloader (in ROM) fails, it displays a 32-bit
hexadecimal number on the top screen, known Stage 1 error codes are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Error Code Description                                          |
|       0000F                                                           |
| E00   Error communicating NAND chip (It's missing, CLK shorted, etc.) |
|       0                                                               |
| 000FEFC   Integrity error in first block of Stage 2 (address at 220h) |
|       00                                                              |
| 00FEFD   Integrity error in second block of Stage 2 (address at 230h) |
|       000                                                             |
| 0FEFE   Boot sector integrity error (Sector 200h not valid), or error |
|                    in NVRAM contents.                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Stage 2**
Unlike the stage1 bootloader, which must be small enough to fit in ROM
(probably several kilobytes), the stage2 bootloader has about a megabyte
of NAND flash reserved for it. The stage2 bootloader understands
partitions and filesystems, and it is capable of loading the DSi menu.
It also must understand the encryption used on filesystem blocks in the
NAND, and it must understand how to load and validate title metadata.
The Stage 2 loader was not modified by the System Menu 1.4 update. This
is still earlier in the boot process than the \"Health and Safety\
warning.
The first stage bootloader reads sector 0x200 in order to find a table
of offsets to the Stage 2 bootloader:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00000220                                                        |
|   00 08 00 00 10 64 02 00  00 80 7b 03 00 66 02 00 |.....d....{..f..| |
|       00000230                                                        |
|   00 6e 02 00 88 75 02 00  00 80 7b 03 00 76 02 00 |.n...u....{..v..| |
|       00000240                                                        |
|   00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 |................| |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This appears to be describing two chunks of the stage2 loader, one
0x26410 bytes in length at address 0x800, and one 0x27588 bytes at
address 0x26e00.
Note that this sector (and two similar ones at 0x400 and 0x600) appear
to be the only unencrypted blocks on the NAND flash.
It is unclear why there are two pieces which are nearly but not quite
the same size. Passive traces of the boot sequence confirm that the
0x26e00 chunk is slightly larger, and it\'s loaded first. The 0x80
chunk is read immediately after the 0x26e00 chunk.
Whereas the filesystem data in NAND is encrypted using a unique key for
every DSi, the stage2 bootloader is identical on every DSi tested so
far. This probably means that it is encrypted using a fixed key included
in stage1.

**After Stage 2 is loaded:**

```

|       2. Sec                                                          |

| . The MBR signature and the type of the first partition are verified. |
|       4. F                                                            |

|   will vary depending on your DSi's firmware version and the state of |
|            i                                                          |

|   after two small metadata files are read from 0xb1c000 and 0x7a0000. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


All Stage 2 errors show before the health and safety screen. It appears
that Stage 2 errors from a cold power-on always cause the DSi to hang at
a black screen, whereas Stage 2 errors after reset (pressing but not
holding the power button) will give an error message screen. Known Stage
2 errors:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Boot Sectors in DSi Debug version**
Debug version bootsectors are almost same as in retail version: There\'
an extra RSA key inserted at ARM9:37CEADCh, and lots of B/BL/BLX/LDR
addresses have changed due to the inserted bytes, but, apart from that
changes, only 5 opcodes are really different, ARM9:37C07A0h,
ARM9:37C0864h, ARM7:37B9110h, ARM7:37B9200h do trigger errors when
SCFG_DEBUG bit0-1 are zero (opposite of retail version), and
ARM9:37B8BA4h uses the extra RSA key at 37CEADCh for Debug Launcher
(instead of the retail key at 1FFC400h).
