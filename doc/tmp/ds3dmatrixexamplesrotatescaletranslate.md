# DS 3D Matrix Examples (Rotate/Scale/Translate)


**Identity Matrix**
The MTX_IDENTITY command can be used to initialize the Position Matrix
before doing any Translation/Scaling/Rotation, for example:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|    Load(Identity)                           ;no rotation/scaling used |
|       Load(Ide                                                        |
| ntity), Mul(Rotate), Mul(Scale)  ;rotation/scaling (not so efficient) |
|       Load(R                                                          |
| otate), Mul(Scale)                 ;rotation/scaling (more efficient) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Rotation Matrices**
Rotation can be performed with MTX_MULT_3x3 command, simple examples
are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Around X-Axis          Around Y-Axis          Around Z-Axis     |
|                                                                       |
|     | 1.0  0     0   |     | cos   0    sin |     | cos   sin   0   | |
|                                                                       |
|     | 0    cos   sin |     | 0     1.0  0   |     | -sin  cos   0   | |
|                                                                       |
|     | 0    -sin  cos |     | -sin  0    cos |     | 0     0     1.0 | |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Scale Matrix**
The MTX_SCALE command allows to adjust the size of the polygon. The
x,y,z parameters should be normally all having the same value, x=y=z
(unless if you want to change only the height of the object, for
example). Identical results can be obtained with MTX_MULT commands,
however, when using lighting (MTX_MODE=2), then scaling should be done
ONLY with MTX_SCALE (which keeps the length of the light\'s directiona
vector intact).

**Translation Matrix**
The MTX_TRANS command allows to move polygons to the desired position.
The polygon VTX commands are spanning only a small range of coordinates
(near zero-coordinate), so translation is required to move the polygons
to other locations in the world coordinates. Aside from that,
translation is useful for moved objects (at variable coordinates), and
for re-using an object at various locations (eg. you can create a forest
by translating a tree to different coordinates).

**Matrix Multiply Order**
The Matrix must be set up BEFORE sending the Vertices (which are then
automatically multiplied by the matrix). When using multiple matrices
multiplied with each other: Mind that, for matrix maths A\*B is NOT th
same as B\*A. For example, if you combine Rotate and Translate Matrices
the object will be either rotated around it\'s own zero-coordinate, o
around world-space zero-coordinate, depending on the multiply order.
