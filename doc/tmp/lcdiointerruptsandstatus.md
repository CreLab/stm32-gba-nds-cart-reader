# LCD I/O Interrupts and Status


**4000004h - DISPSTAT - General LCD Status (Read/Write)**
Display status and Interrupt control. The H-Blank conditions are
generated once per scanline, including for the \'hidden\' scanline
during V-Blank.

```

The V-Count-Setting value is much the same as LYC of older gameboys,
when its value is identical to the content of the VCOUNT register then
the V-Counter flag is set (Bit 2), and (if enabled in Bit 5) an
interrupt is requested.
Although the drawing time is only 960 cycles (240\*4), the H-Blank fla
is \"0\" for a total of 1006 cycles.

**4000006h - VCOUNT - Vertical Counter (Read only)**
Indicates the currently drawn scanline, values in range from 160..227
indicate \'hidden\' scanlines within VBlank area.

Note: This is much the same than the \'LY\' register of older gameboys.
