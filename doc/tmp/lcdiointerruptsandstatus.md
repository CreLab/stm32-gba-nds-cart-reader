# LCD I/O Interrupts and Status


### 4000004h - DISPSTAT - General LCD Status (Read/Write)
Display status and Interrupt control. The H-Blank conditions are generated once per scanline, including for the \'hidden\' scanlines during V-Blank.

|       0     V-Blank flag   (Read only) (1=VBlank) (set in line 160..226; not 227) |
|       1     H-Blank flag   (Read only) (1=HBlank) (toggled in all lines, 0..227)  |

|       7     Not used (0) / NDS: MSB of V-Vcount Setting (LYC.Bit8) (0..262)(R/W)  |
|       8-15  V-Count Setting (LYC)      (0..227)                            (R/W)  |

```

The V-Count-Setting value is much the same as LYC of older gameboys, when its value is identical to the content of the VCOUNT register then the V-Counter flag is set (Bit 2), and (if enabled in Bit 5) an interrupt is requested.
Although the drawing time is only 960 cycles (240\*4), the H-Blank flag is \"0\" for a total of 1006 cycles.

### 4000006h - VCOUNT - Vertical Counter (Read only)
Indicates the currently drawn scanline, values in range from 160..227 indicate \'hidden\' scanlines within VBlank area.

|       0-7   Current Scanline (LY)      (0..227)                              (R) |
|       8     Not used (0) / NDS: MSB of Current Scanline (LY.Bit8) (0..262)   (R) |
|       9-15  Not Used (0)                                                         |

Note: This is much the same than the \'LY\' register of older gameboys.
