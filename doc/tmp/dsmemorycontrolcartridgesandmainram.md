Bit0-6 can be changed by both NDS9 and NDS7, changing these bits affects
the local EXMEM register only, not that of the other CPU.
Bit7-15 can be changed by NDS9 only, changing these bits affects both
EXMEM registers, ie. both NDS9 and NDS7 can read the current NDS9
setting.
Bit14=0 is intended for GBA mode, however, writes to this bit appear to
be ignored?

**GBA Slot (8000000h-AFFFFFFh)**
The GBA Slot can be mapped to ARM9 or ARM7 via EXMEMCNT.7.
For the selected CPU, memory at 8000000h-9FFFFFFh contains the \"GB
ROM\" region, and memory at A000000h-AFFFFFFh contains the \"GBA SRAM\
region (repeated every 64Kbytes). If there is no cartridge in GBA Slot,
then the ROM/SRAM regions will contain open-bus values: SRAM region is
FFh-filled (High-Z). And ROM region is filled by increasing 16bit values
(Addr/2), possibly ORed with garbage depending on the selected ROM
Access Time:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       6 clks   --> returns "Addr/2"                                   |
|       8 clks   --> returns "Addr/2"                                   |
|       10 clks  --> returns "Addr/2 OR FE08h" (or similar garbage)     |
|       18 clks  --> returns "FFFFh" (High-Z)                           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For the deselected CPU, all memory at 8000000h-AFFFFFFh becomes
00h-filled, this is required for bugged games like Digimon Story: Super
Xros Wars (which is accidently reading deselected GBA SRAM at
- \[main_ram_base+main_ram_addr\*4\], whereas it does presumably want t
- read Main RAM at \[main_ram_base+index\*4\]).
