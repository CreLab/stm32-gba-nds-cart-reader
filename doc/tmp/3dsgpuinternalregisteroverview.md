# 3DS GPU Internal Register Overview


### Aliases
It is possible for multiple register (sequential) IDs to correspond to the same register. This is done to leverage the consecutive writing mode for GPU commands, which makes it possible for a single command to write data to multiple sequential register IDs. For example, register IDs 02C1 through 02C8 all correspond to GPUREG_VSH_FLOATUNIFORM_DATAi so that a consecutively writing command based at 02C0 will write its first parameter to GPUREG_VSH_FLOATUNIFORM_INDEX and ever subsequent ones to GPUREG_VSH_FLOATUNIFORM_DATAi

|       signed          Signed integer                                           |
|       unsigned        Unsigned integer                                         |
|       floatX.Y.Z      Floating-point number with X sign bits, Y exponent bits, |
|                         and Z mantissa bits                                    |
|       fixedX.Y.Z      Fixed-point number with X sign bits, Y integer bits,     |
|                         and Z fractional bits                                  |
