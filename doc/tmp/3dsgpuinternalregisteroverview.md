# 3DS GPU Internal Register Overview


**Aliases**
It is possible for multiple register (sequential) IDs to correspond to
the same register. This is done to leverage the consecutive writing mode
for GPU commands, which makes it possible for a single command to write
data to multiple sequential register IDs. For example, register IDs 02C1
through 02C8 all correspond to GPUREG_VSH_FLOATUNIFORM_DATAi so that a
consecutively writing command based at 02C0 will write its first
parameter to GPUREG_VSH_FLOATUNIFORM_INDEX and ever subsequent ones to
GPUREG_VSH_FLOATUNIFORM_DATAi
