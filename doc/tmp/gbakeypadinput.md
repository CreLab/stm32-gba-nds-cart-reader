It\'d be usually recommended to read-out this register only once pe
frame, and to store the current state in memory. As a side effect, this
method avoids problems caused by switch bounce when a key is newly
released or pressed.

**4000132h - KEYCNT - Key Interrupt Control (R/W)**
The keypad IRQ function is intended to terminate the very-low-power Stop
mode, it is not suitable for processing normal user input, to do this,
most programs are invoking their keypad handlers from within VBlank
IRQ.

```

In logical OR mode, an interrupt is requested when at least one of the
selected buttons is pressed.
In logical AND mode, an interrupt is requested when ALL of the selected
buttons are pressed.

**Notes**
In 8bit gameboy compatibility mode, L and R Buttons are used to toggle
the screen size between normal 160x144 pixels and stretched 240x144
pixels.
The GBA SP is additionally having a \* Button used to toggle th
backlight on and off (controlled by separate hardware logic, there\'s n
way to detect or change the current backlight state by software).
