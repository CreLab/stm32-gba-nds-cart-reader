# 3DS Files - Video Layout Images (CLIM/FLIM)


CLIM/FLIM files contain texture bitmaps, commonly used for GUI layout
(rather than for 3D game engines). CLIM is the standard format for 3DS,
FLIM appears to be more common on Wii-U (but is also used on 3DS).

The Texture Format values don\'t use the same numbering as the GPU. Th
following table can be used to translate CLIM and FLIM numbers to GPU
numbers:

```

| to_gpu_table: 07h,08h,09h,05h,06h,03h,01h,02h,04h,00h,0Ch,0Dh,0Ah,0Bh |

```

- [3DS GPU Texture Formats](./3dsgputextureformats.md)
The CLIM/FLIM width/height entries can be odd, the actual sizes are
rounded to powers of two, with at least 8 pixels (for example, 33x4
would become 64x8, that includes several completely unused 8x8 tiles
which are nethertheless stored in the CLIM/FLIM file).

**FLIM**
3DS eShop FLIM files are somewhat mirrored and rotated (they can be
decoded using pixel order for the height/width entries; but they must be
mirrored and/or rotated left or right after decoding (which will swap
height/width to width/height).
3DS eShop FLIM is using the same Texture Format numbers as CLIM (up to
including 0Ch=L4 and 0Dh=A4). However, there is a webpage claiming other
numbers to be used (which might be nonsense, or maybe there is \"anothe
FLIM format for Wii-U\")
