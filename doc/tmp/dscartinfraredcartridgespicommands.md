# DS Cart Infrared Cartridge SPI Commands


There are two NDS cart firmware versions with minor differences:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       OLD was used in Walk with Me (maybe also Active Health?)        |
|       NEW was used in the P-Letter game series                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The IR-port is accessed via SPI bus commands; that bus is also shared
for accessing FLASH/EEPROM memory (via 00h-prefix).

**SPI Transfers**
The SPI transfers are working at max 1MHz transfer clock, and they do
require a delay after each byte:
Waiting 800h clks at 33MHz seems to work okay (eg. MOV r0,200h // SWI
03h on ARM7). The NEW ROM version disables IR polling when doing the SPI
transfers for RX/TX data blocks (so it may work with shorter delays
- between the data\[\...\] bytes).
The savedata access is directly passed to the FLASH/EEPROM chip and does
work at 4MHz without delays (except, the leading 00h prefix must be
transferred at 1MHz plus delay, and another delay is needed when
releasing chipselect after last byte).
Note: The NDS cart slot IRQ pin is GNDed in Walk with Me (ie. there is
no IRQ for SPI/IR status).
SPI access does require cart power on and reset (via DSi SCFG
registers), but doesn\'t require any ROM commands like secure are
loading. Confusingly, the ROM Chip ID seems to have an IR flag in bit0
of 3rd byte (although the ROM chip isn\'t wired to IR hardware at all).

**IR Transfers**
The IR transfers are using a fixed baudrate: 115200 baud, 8n1,
one-directional (RX gets disabled during TX). The RX/TX commands are
transferring \"packets\" (with each \"packet\" being terminated by 
\"pause\" in the IR transmission; that \"packet+pause\" mechanism i
making it impossible to use streaming for transferring larger blocks
that exceed the buffer size of max 84h or B8h bytes).
The RX command will return empty data with len=00h until a WHOLE packet
has been received via IR.
The TX command won\'t start the IR transfer until the WHOLE packet ha
been written via SPI, with packet end indicated by releasing chip
select.
There is no way to detect TX transfer end (other than computing the
expected tranfer time and using an ARM timer).
However, Nintendo is sending a Reply for most TX commands, so one can
simply wait for RX packets to determine TX completion (if neither Reply
nor Checksum Error are received then one will still need timeout
handling).

**Memory Read/Write**
These commands are normally not used. The memory commands do forcefully
abort IR transfers, so they can\'t be used for polling IR transfe
status.
However, they can be used for dumping the firmware ROM, and they could
be used to upload/execute custom code in RAM, which may allow to
overcome some of the above IR transfer restrictions (other baudrates,
fewer delays, better streaming, not ignoring byte F2h, etc).

**IR Cart Detection**
NDS/DSi Carts with IR support are having special game code with \"I\" i
first letter (NTR-Ixxx or TWL-Ixxx). There are reportedly pirate/bootleg
versions of the P-Letter games without IR hardware, unknown if they do
nethertheless have the \"I\" in the gamecode.
Emulators can detect the leading 00h prefix for Savedata access,
although that detection may go wrong if preceeded by IR access.
Emulators can additionally detect the slow 1MHz SPI clock used for IR
access (and for 00h prefix).
