# DS Sound Files - SWAR (Sound Wave Archive)


It is a collection of mono wave (SWAV) samples only (which can be in
either PCM8, PCM16 or ADPCM compression).

```

When extracting single sample block, one can convert them to SWAV files
(by inserting an 18h-byte SWAV header).
The sample blocks are usually (always?) stored at increasing offsets (so
one can determine the size by computing the distance to next offset; or
to filesize for last entry) (alternately, the size can be computed by
looking at the Sound Length entry of sample block).
