The ARM7 Exception Vectors are located at 00000000h. The IRQ handler redirects to \[3FFFFFCh aka 380FFFCh\].

### Further Memory (not mapped to ARM9/ARM7 bus)

```

|       GBA-BIOS (16KB) (not used in NDS mode)                          |
|       NDS Slot ROM (serial 8bit-bus, max 4GB with default protocol)   |
|       NDS Slot FLASH/EEPROM/FRAM (serial 1bit-bus)                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Shared-RAM
Even though Shared WRAM begins at 3000000h, programs are commonly using mirrors at 37F8000h (both ARM9 and ARM7). At the ARM7-side, this allows to use 32K Shared WRAM and 64K ARM7-WRAM as a continous 96K RAM block.

### Undefined I/O Ports
On the NDS (at the ARM9-side at least) undefined I/O ports are always zero.

### Undefined Memory Regions
16MB blocks that do not contain any defined memory regions (or that contain only mapped TCM regions) are typically completely undefined.
16MB blocks that do contain valid memory regions are typically containing mirrors of that memory in the unused upper part of the 16MB area (only exceptions are TCM and BIOS which are not mirrored).
