**Shared-RAM**
Even though Shared WRAM begins at 3000000h, programs are commonly using
mirrors at 37F8000h (both ARM9 and ARM7). At the ARM7-side, this allows
to use 32K Shared WRAM and 64K ARM7-WRAM as a continous 96K RAM block.

**Undefined I/O Ports**
On the NDS (at the ARM9-side at least) undefined I/O ports are always
zero.

**Undefined Memory Regions**
16MB blocks that do not contain any defined memory regions (or that
contain only mapped TCM regions) are typically completely undefined.
16MB blocks that do contain valid memory regions are typically
containing mirrors of that memory in the unused upper part of the 16MB
area (only exceptions are TCM and BIOS which are not mirrored).
