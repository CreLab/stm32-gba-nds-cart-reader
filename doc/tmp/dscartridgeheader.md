DSi Cartridges are using an extended cartridge header,
- [DSi Cartridge Header](./dsicartridgeheader.md)
Some of that new/changed DSi header entries are important even in NDS
mode:
- On DSi, ARM9/ARM7 areas are restricted to 2.75MB (instead 3.8MB on
real NDS)
- New NDS titles must have RSA signatures (and old titles must be in
whitelist)

For more info about CRC-16, see description of GetCRC16 BIOS function,
- [BIOS Misc Functions](./biosmiscfunctions.md)
- For the Logo checksum, the BIOS verifies only \[15Ch\]=CF56h, it doe
- NOT verify the actual data at \[0C0h-15Bh\] (nor it\'s checksum)
however, the data is verified by the firmware.

**Secure Area Delay**
- The Secure Area Delay at header\[06Eh\] is counted in 130.912kHz unit
(which can be clocked via one of the hardware timers with
prescaler=F/256 and reload=(10000h-((X AND 3FFFh)+2)); for some weird
reason, in case of Header checksum it\'s ANDed with 1FFFh instead o
3FFFh). Commonly used values are X=051Eh (10ms), and X=0D7Eh (26ms).
The delay is used for all Blowfish encrypted commands, the actual
usage/purpose differs depending on bit31 of the ROM Chip ID:
When ChipID.Bit31=0 (commands are sent ONCE): The delay is issued BEFORE
sending the command:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Delay,Cmd                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Older/newer games are using delays of 10ms/26ms (although all known
existing cartridges with Bit31=0 would actually work WITHOUT delays).
When ChipID.Bit31=1 (commands are repeated MULTIPLE times): The delay is
issued AFTER sending the command for the FIRST time:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Cmd,Delay,Cmd                                ;for 2x repeat     |
|       Cmd,Delay,Cmd,Cmd,Cmd,Cmd,Cmd,Cmd,Cmd,Cmd    ;for 9x repeat     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Known games are using delays of 26ms (although all known existing
cartridges (=Cooking Coach) with Bit31=1 would actually work with
shorter delays of ca. 7ms (but, better use 8ms for safety)).

**NDS Gamecodes**
This is the same code as the NTR-UTTD (NDS) or TWL-UTTD (DSi) code which
is printed on the package and sticker on (commercial) cartridges
(excluding the leading \"NTR-\" or \"TWL-\" part).

```

|   U  Unique Code          (usually "A", "B", "C", or special meaning) |
|       TT Short Title          (eg. "PM" for Pac Man)                  |
|       D                                                               |
