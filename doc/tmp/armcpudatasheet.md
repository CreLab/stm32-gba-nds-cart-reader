# ARM CPU Data Sheet


This present document is an attempt to supply a brief ARM7TDMI reference, hopefully including all information which is relevant for programmers.

Some details that I have treated as meaningless for GBA programming aren\'t included - such like Big Endian format, and Virtual Memory data aborts, and most of the chapters listed below.

Have a look at the complete data sheet (URL see below) for more detailed verbose information about ARM7TDMI instructions. That document also includes:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - Signal Description                                             |
|        Pins of the original CPU, probably other for GBA.              |
|      - Memory Interface                                               |
|        Optional virtual memory circuits, etc. not for GBA.            |
|      - Coprocessor Interface                                          |
|        As far as I know, none such in GBA.                            |
|      - Debug Interface                                                |
|        For external hardware-based debugging.                         |
|      - ICEBreaker Module                                              |
|        For external hardware-based debugging also.                    |
|      - Instruction Cycle Operations                                   |
|        Detailed: What happens during each cycle of each instruction.  |
|      - DC Parameters (Power supply)                                   |
|      - AC Parameters (Signal timings)                                 |
