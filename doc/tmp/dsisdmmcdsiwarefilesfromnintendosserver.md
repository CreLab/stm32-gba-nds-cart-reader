# DSi SD/MMC DSiware Files from Nintendo\'s Server


**<http://nus.cdn.t.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/000300tt4ggggggg/000000vv>**
The \"000000vv\" file contains the \".app\" file (in encrypted form).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Server:  "000000vv"      (AES-CBC encrypted, raw)               |
|       eMMC:    "000000vv.app"  (decrypted, raw)                       |
|       SD Card: "GGGGGGGG.bin"  (ES-block encrypted, with extra data)  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

First, the encrypted Title Key must be decrypted (via AES-CBC):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- |    KEY[00h..0Fh] = Common Key (AF,1B,F5,16,...)        ;from ARM7BIOS |
- |       IV[                                                             |
- | 00h..07h]  = Title ID (00,03,00,tt,gg,gg,gg,gg)  ;from tik/cetk[1DCh] |
- |       IV[08h..0Fh]  = Zerofilled                          ;padding    |
|       Inp                                                             |
- | ut: Encrypted Title Key                          ;from tik/cetk[1BFh] |
|       Outp                                                            |
| ut: Decrypted Title Key                         ;for use in next step |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Then, the actual executable/file can be decrypted (also via AES-CBC):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- |  KEY[00h..0Fh] = Decrypted Title Key                 ;from above step |
- |       IV[00h                                                          |
- | ..01h]  = Usually Zero (or "Index" from tmd?) ;from tmd[1E8h+N*24h] ? |
- |       IV[02h..0Fh]  = Zerofilled                          ;padding    |
|       In                                                              |
| put: Encrypted file "000000vv"                    ;from http download |
|                                                                       |
|    Output: Decrypted file "000000vv.app"               ;saved on eMMC |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The above decryption steps do require a big-endian AES-CBC software
implementation (the DSi hardware supports only little-endian, and it
supports only AES-CTR and AES-CCM, and, especially, it supports only the
\"encrypt\" key schedule, whilst AES-CBC would require a differen
\"decrypt\" key schedule).

**<http://nus.cdn.t.shop.nintendowifi.net/ccs/download/000300tt4ggggggg/tmd.nn>**
These files do contain tickets (\"cetk\"), and title metadata (\"tmd\
for newest version, plus \"tmd.nn\" for older versions; wit
nn=0,1,256,257,512 and the like).
- [DSi SD/MMC DSiware Tickets and Titlemetadata](./dsisdmmcdsiwareticketsandtitlemetadata.md)
The \"cetk\" file is available only for free system updates (not fo
titles sold commercially in DSi Shop).

**Downloading**
The files can be downloaded with normal web browsers. The homebrew \"NU
Downloader\" utility is also allowing to download those files (and t
decrypt them, provided that the \"cetk\" is available).
For free system updates, tickets can be downloaded as \"cetk\" files
For titles sold commercially in DSi ship, tickets must be purchased
somehow differently.
For example, the updates for DSi System Settings (EUR) can be downloaded
from:

```

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The tmd and cetk files are unencrypted. The 00000002 and 00000003 files
are encrypted executables (containing System Settings v2 and v3).

**Older Versions**
Nintendo is usually keeping older \"000000vv\" files on their server, s
one could still download those older versions.
The oldest/original version would be usually \"00000000\", however, i
case of system files that are pre-installed on all consoles, only later
versions are available as updates (ie. starting with \"00000001\", o
for some reason, with \"00000002\", in case of system settings).
The tmd/cetk files are available only for the newest version (meaning
that some cosmetic values like title size & title version are adjusted
for the newest version; the cetk\'s AES-CBC key usually doesn\'t chang
for updates, so older versions can be still decrypted with newer
cetk\'s).
Older versions are usually deleted on internal eMMC storage, so only the
\"000000vv.app\" file exists.
