# DSi SD/MMC I/O Ports: Interrupt/Status


All SD/MMC IRQs are triggering IF2.8, CardIRQ does ADDITIONALLY trigger
IF2.9
All SDIO IRQs are triggering IF2.10, CardIRQ does ADDITIONALLY trigger
IF2.11?

**400481Ch/4004A1Ch - SD_IRQ_STATUS0-1 - Interrupt Status (R/ack)**
**4004820h/4004A20h - SD_IRQ_MASK0-1 - Interrupt Mask (R/W)**
The IRQ_STATUS registers contain acknowledge-able IRQ Flags (those bits
that that are maskable in IRQ_MASK register), as well as static
read-only status bits without IRQ function (eg. WRPROTECT).
IRQ Flags/Write (0=Acknowledge, 1=No change)
IRQ Flags/Read (0=No IRQ, 1=IRQ)
IRQ Mask (0=Enable, 1=Disable) (8B7F031Dh when all IRQs disabled)

Normally, IRQs should be acknowledged by writing \"FLAGS=NOT X\", whils
the firmware is using an unstable \"FLAGS=FLAGS AND NOT X\
read-modify-write function (accidentally acknowledging any IRQs that
have newly occurred during that operation).

All stat bits (except bit1) are triggered only if enabled in
SD_CARD_IRQ_CTL.
Bit0 is actually used (for SDIO hardware), the other bits aren\'t use
by existing software (they don\'t seem to be useful; purpose might b
error testing, or forcing commands to abort).

**4004834h/4004A34h - SD_CARD_IRQ_CTL (R/W)**
CardIRQ Enable works only when also writing SD_CARD_PORT_SELECT.bit10=0
and only with valid SD_CARD_CLK_CTL setting.

Bit9 is autocleared at time when bit9 causes setting
SD_CARD_IRQ_STAT.bit14.
Bit2 is autocleared shortly before bit8 causes CMDTIMEOUT.
SD_CARD_IRQ_STAT.bit15 is set only when setting bit8 AND bit2 DURING
cmd/xfer.

The 3DS bootroom is using bit0-2 for eMMC insert/eject detection. DSi
software isn\'t doing such stuff (though the registers seem to exist i
DSi hardware, too). Either way, eMMC cannot be ejected on neither DSi
nor 3DS, so the feature is kinda useless.

Some of the unknown bits might be CD/Data3 or IRQ/Data1 pins for Device
1, in similar way as for Device 0 (maybe that is in bit16-18, which are
observed to become nonzero in certain situations).
EXT_IRQ_STAT can be 00000000h..00070004h for MMC, or always 00000000h
for SDIO (as there\'s only one device on SDIO bus). EXT_IRQ_MASK is R/
(can be 00240024h..00FF00FFh) for both SD/MMC and SDIO.

Bit8,9 are extra IRQ flags, the flags get set ONLY in DATA32 mode (not
in DATA16 mode).
Bit8,9 are somewhat edge-triggered (setting the IF2 bit only on
NoIRQ-to-IRQ transitions; whilst Disable-to-Enable transitions don\'
trigger IF2).
Bit8,9 don\'t need to be acknowledged, they are automatically switche
to \"No IRQ\" by hardware (when reading/writing DATA32_FIFO, ie. whe
the FIFO is no longer empty/full).

**400482Ch/4004A2Ch - SD_ERROR_DETAIL_STATUS0-1 - Error Detail Status
(R)**
This register contains extra info about the error bits in SD_IRQ_STATUS.
The error bits (except bit13/always set) are automatically cleared when
sending a new command by writing to SD_CMD.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: CMD12 is STOP_TRANSMISSION (automatically sent after BLK_COUNT
blocks).
The four \"auto-issued CMD12\" bits exist for SD registers only (not fo
SDIO, going by old toshiba datasheets; which may be wrong).
SCMDE is probably in bit1 (though, official specs say bit0, which would
be same as RCMDE).
Some error bits can be intentionally provoked: Bit8=1 when programming
the controller to expect GET_STATUS to return a 136bit response. Bit16=1
when sending GET_CID in \"tran\" state. Bit20=1 when sending GET_STATU
configured to expect a data/read reply. Bit21=1 when sending GET_STATUS
configured to expect a data/write block (and with actually sending a
data block to it).

| RPROTECT_2 for onboard eMMC (usually/always 0=Unlocked)           (R) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bit0 is write-protect flag for onboard eMMC (equivalent to the SD/MMC
slot\'s write-protect switch in 400481Ch.bit7, but in inverted form
0=Unlocked for eMMC, instead of 0=Locked for SD/MMC). The firmware does
check bit0 (and, if set, hangs shortly before starting games), unknown
if the TWL CPU and DSi mainboard do actually have any solder pads for
it.

**IRQ Edge-Triggering**
One nasty \"feature\" for both IRQ_STATUS and DATA32_IRQ is that th
interrupts are edge-triggered (IF2.bit8 gets set only on No-IRQ-to-IRQ
transitions) (IF2 can be acknowledged even if IRQ(s) are still
requested, which would mean that those IRQ(s) would get lost).
Workaround would be:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - first acknowledge IF2.bit8 (must be done before next step)     |
|      -                                                                |
| then check for pending IRQs in IRQ_STATUS and DATA32_IRQ, and process |
|        all of them                                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Ie. if you would process only a single IRQ, then any other IRQs would
get lost.
For IRQ_STATUS, one could also force unprocessed IRQs to re-trigger IF2
by temporarily disabling IRQ_MASK bits (disable-to-enable for pending
IRQs is also edge-triggering IF2). That trick works for IRQ_STATUS only,
not for DATA32_IRQ.
