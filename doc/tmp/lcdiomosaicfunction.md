# LCD I/O Mosaic Function


**400004Ch - MOSAIC - Mosaic Size (W)**
The Mosaic function can be separately enabled/disabled for BG0-BG3 by
BG0CNT-BG3CNT Registers, as well as for each OBJ0-127 by OBJ attributes
in OAM memory. Also, setting all of the bits below to zero effectively
disables the mosaic function.

Example: When setting H-Size to 5, then pixels 0-5 of each display row
are colorized as pixel 0, pixels 6-11 as pixel 6, pixels 12-17 as pixel
12, and so on.

Normally, a \'mosaic-pixel\' is colorized by the color of the upperlef
covered pixel. In many cases it might be more desireful to use the color
of the pixel in the center of the covered area - this effect may be
gained by scrolling the background (or by adjusting the OBJ position, as
far as upper/left rows/columns of OBJ are transparent).
