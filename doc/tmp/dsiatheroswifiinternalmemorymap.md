# DSi Atheros Wifi - Internal Memory Map


**Overall Memory Map (Internal Xtensa memory)**
Internal Memory contains I/O Ports, ROM, and RAM. Arranged as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00000000h  I/O Ports                                            |
|                                                                       |
|   000E0000h  ROM        ;\as so on AR6002 (other AR60xx chips may use 
|       00100000h  RAM        ;/slightly different addresses).          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The whole memory is repeated every 400000h bytes (4MByte), this is just
dumb mirroring (although Atheros is referring to it as \"virtua
memory\"). The first three mirrors (in first 12Mbytes) are commonly use
as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000                                                            |
| 0000h..003FFFFh  used for I/O Port read/write             ;1st mirror |
|       0040                                                            |
| 0000h..007FFFFh  used for ROM and RAM data read/write     ;2nd mirror |
|       0080                                                            |
| 0000h..00BFFFFh  used for ROM and RAM opcode read         ;3rd mirror |
|       00C00                                                           |
| 000h..FFFFFFFh  normally unused                          ;4th..1024th |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Unknown how far it is really required to use the mirrors that way. The
different areas might be related to different access rights, or caching
(although the AR6002/AR6003/AR6004 chips don\'t have any cache at all).
The AR6002 BIOS does usually read ROM data from 4E0000h..4F3FFFh,
however, in one case it\'s accidently reading ROM data fro
8EEFF8h..8EF73Bh, so that\'s apparently possible & working, too.
Using WINDOW_DATA to read memory works well for address
00000000h..FFFFFFFFh (apart from some dangerous read-locations in the
I/O area; as well as mirrors of those I/O locations).

**Special ROM Addresses**
There are only a few ROM locations with fixed/standarized addresses:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Entrypoint:        ROM_Base+0                                   |
|       Exception Vectors: ROM_Base+xxx ?                               |
|       DataSet Address:   ROM_Base+ROM_Size-8                          |
|       MBIST C                                                         |
| ksum:       ROM_Base+ROM_Size-4  ;MBIST = memory built-in-self-test ? |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The firmware may call ROM functions, but the firmware code must be
matched to specific ROM versions: There is some call table in RAM,
allowing to call (or change) function vectors, but the table\'
location/indices vary for different ROM versions. The RAM table doesn\'
contain entries for all ROM functions though, so the firmware must use
hardcoded addresses (like \"8E35A0h\") for functions that aren\'t in th
table.
Note that it\'s possible to patch ROM via TCAM/BCAM registers.

**Special RAM Addresses**
The first some kilobytes of RAM contain stuff like stack, call table,
variables, and host interest area (but the exact addresses of that
regions depend on the ROM version).
The remaining RAM could be more or less freely used by the firmware
(whereas, one should probably use ROM\'s memory allocation function fo
that purpose).
The CPU\'s \"litbase\" is dictacted by the ROM, so the firmware mus
adapt its literal pool offsets to that value. The default BMI_DONE
entrypoint is also dictated by the ROM (although one could override it
if neccessary).

**Hardware I/O Addresses**
The hardware I/O addresses are defined in source code folder
\"include\\AR6002\\hw\*\". Whereas, the folder is called \"AR6002\", bu
it does also contain defintions for AR6003 and AR6004. In a similar
fashion, the source code does also contain definitions like AR6002_REVn,
whereas some of that \"AR6002 revisions\" are actually referring t
AR6003 and AR6004. The naming scheme appears to be as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       AR6002 = AR6002_REV2 = include\AR6002\hw2.0                     
|       AR6003 = AR6002_REV4 = include\AR6002\hw4.0                     
|       AR6004 = AR6002_REV6 = include\AR6002\hw6.0                     
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The above folders are included in all source code versions (newer
atheros code from 2010 is definetly no longer compatible with the DSi\'
AR6002 firmware, however, concerning the hardware definitions, the
\"hw2.0\" folder appears to have stayed intact and should be stil
compatible with real hardware, even in newer source code versions).
However, there are at least two different \"hw4.0\" versions, the newe
one containing some additional registers, and some changed register
addresses. There\'s also some AR6002_REV42 definition in some files
which might be related to that \"hw4.0\" variant. Current theory woul
be that \"hw4.0\" means AR6003, and the newer \"hw4.0\" should b
actually \"hw4.2\" and means some different chip with unknown name. O
whatever.
There\'s also a \"include\\AR6002\\hw\" folder, this is just som
useless dupe, containing the exact same files as
\"include\\AR6002\\hw2.0\".
There\'s also something called \"MCKINLEY\", which seems to same (o
similar) as \"AR6004\".
The actual files in the above folders are containing some very ugly
bloated auto-generated definitions, definetly not suitable for human
reading (except by using some software parser for extracting relevant
definitions).
