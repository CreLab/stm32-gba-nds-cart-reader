# GBA Cart Real-Time Clock (RTC)


S3511 - 8pin RTC with 3-wire serial bus (used in Boktai)

The RTC chip is (almost) the same as used in NDS consoles:
- [DS Real-Time Clock (./dsrealtimeclockrtc.md)
The chip is accessed via 4bit I/O port (only 3bits are used for RTC):
- [GBA Cart I/O Port (./gbacartioportgpio.md)

Setting after Battery-Shortcut is 82h. Setting after Force-Reset is
00h.
Unused bits seem to be always zero, but might be read-only or
write-only?

**Datetime and Time Registers**
Same as NDS, except AM/PM flag moved from hour.bit6 (NDS) to hour.bit7
(GBA).

**Force Reset/Irq Registers**
Used to reset all RTC registers (all used registers become 00h, except
day/month which become 01h), or to drag the IRQ output LOW for a short
moment. These registers are strobed by ANY access to them, ie. by both
writing to, as well as reading from these registers.

**Pin-Outs / IRQ Signal**
The package has identical pin-outs as in NDS, although it is slightly
larger than the miniature chip in the DS.
For whatever reason, the RTC\'s /IRQ output is passed through a
inverter (contained in the ROM-chip), the inverted signal is then passed
to the /IRQ pin on the cartridge slot. So, IRQ\'s will be triggered o
the \"wrong\" edge - possible somehow in relation with detectin
cartridge-removal IRQs?
