+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

MCR/MRC supported by ARMv2 and up, MCR2/MRC2 by ARMv5 and up.
A22i syntax allows to use MOV with Rd specified as first (dest), or last
(source) operand. Native MCR/MRC syntax uses Rd as middle operand,
\<cp\> can be ommited if \<cp\> is zero.
When using MCR with R15: Coprocessor will receive a data value of
PC+12.
When using MRC with R15: Bit 31-28 of data are copied to Bit 31-28 of
CPSR (ie. N,Z,C,V flags), other data bits are ignored, CPSR Bit 27-0 are
not affected, R15 (PC) is not affected.
Execution time: 1S+bI+1C for MCR, 1S+(b+1)I+1C for MRC.
Return: For MRC only: Either R0-R14 modified, or flags affected (see
above).
For details refer to original ARM docs. The opcodes are irrelevant for
GBA/NDS7 because no coprocessor exists (except for a dummy CP14 unit).
However, NDS9 includes a working CP15 unit. And, 3DS ARM11 uses
CP10/CP11 as VFP floating point unit.
