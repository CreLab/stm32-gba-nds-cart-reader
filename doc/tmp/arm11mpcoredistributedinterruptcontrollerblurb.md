# ARM11 MPCore Distributed Interrupt Controller (Blurb)


**10.1.1 Distributed Interrupt Controller clock frequency**
The Distributed Interrupt Controller logic is clocked at half the
frequency of the MPCore CPUs because of power and area considerations.
Reducing clock speed reduces dynamic power consumption. The lower clock
speed requires less pipelining in the design. This means that the
overall impact of the reduced clock speed on the Distributed Interrupt
Controller is kept to a minimum.
Note
As a consequence, the minimum pulse width of signals driving external
interrupt lines is two CPU clock cycles.

**10.2 Terminology - From point of view of an MP11 CPU, an interrupt can
be:**

|       Pend                                                            |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

An interrupt can be Pending and Active at the same time. This can happen
in the case of edge triggered interrupts, when the interrupt is asserted
while the MP11 CPU has not finished handling the first occurrence. For
level-sensitive interrupts it can only happen if software triggers it.
See Interrupt Configuration Registers, 0xC00-0xC3C on page 10-17.

The Distributed Interrupt Controller consists of:
Interrupt Distributor:
The Interrupt Distributor handles interrupt detection and interrupt
prioritization.
CPU interrupt interfaces:
There is one CPU interrupt interface per MP11 CPU. The MP11 CPU
interrupt interfaces handle interrupt acknowledgement, interrupt
masking, and interrupt completion acknowledgement.

**10.3 Interrupt Distributor**
The Interrupt Distributor centralizes all interrupt sources for the
ARM11 MPCore processor before dispatching the highest priority ones to
each individual MP11 CPU.
All interrupt sources are identified by a unique ID. All interrupt
sources have their own configurable priority and list of targeted CPUs,
that is, a list of CPUs to which the interrupt is sent when triggered by
the Interrupt Distributor.
Note
nFIQ interrupts are not handled by the Distributed Interrupt Controller
so that nFIQ interrupt input pins are directly routed to their
respective CPU.
Interrupt sources are of the following types:
**Interprocessor interrupts (IPI)**
Each MP11 CPU has private interrupts, ID0-ID15, that can only be
triggered by software. These interrupts are aliased so that there is no
requirement for a requesting MP11 CPU to determine its own ID when it
deals with IPIs. The priority of an IPI depends on the receiving CPU,
not the sending CPU.
**Private timer and/or watchdog interrupts.**
Each MP11 CPU has its own private timer and watchdog that can generate
interrupts, using ID29 and ID30.
**A legacy nIRQ pin**
In legacy IRQ mode the legacy nIRQ pin, on a per CPU basis, bypasses the
Interrupt Distributor logic and directly drives interrupt requests into
- the MP11 CPU. In legacy IRQ mode, if bit \[0\] of the CPU Interfac
Control Register is 0, then no interrupts are raised based on input from
- the Interrupt Distributor. If bit \[0\] is 1, then all interrupts ar
received from the Interrupt Distributor.
When an MP11 CPU uses the Distributed Interrupt Controller (rather than
the legacy pin in the legacy mode) by enabling its own CPU interface,
the legacy nIRQ pin is treated like other interrupt lines and uses
ID31.
**Hardware interrupts**
Hardware interrupts are triggered by programmable events on associated
interrupt input lines. MP11 CPUs can support up to 224 interrupt input
lines. The interrupt input lines can be configured to be edge sensitive
(posedge) or level sensitive (high level). Hardware interrupts start at
ID32.

**10.3.1 Interrupt Distributor overview**
The Interrupt Distributor holds the list of Pending interrupts for each
CPU, and then selects the highest priority interrupt before issuing it
to the CPU interface. Interrupts of equal priority are resolved by
selecting the lowest ID.
The Interrupt Distributor consists of a register-based list of
interrupts, their priorities and activation requirements (CPU targets).
In addition the state of each interrupt on each CPU is held in the
associated state storage.
The prioritization logic is physically duplicated for each CPU to enable
the selection of the highest priority for each CPU.
The Interrupt Distributor holds the central list of interrupts,
processors and activation information, and is responsible for triggering
software interrupts to processors.
The CPU Interface acknowledges interrupts and changes interrupt priority
masks.

The Interrupt Distributor transmits to the CPU interrupt interfaces
their highest Pending interrupt. It receives back the information that
the interrupt has been acknowledged, and can then change the status of
the corresponding interrupt. The CPU Interface also transmits End of
Interrupt Information (EOI), which enables the Interrupt Distributor to
update the status of this interrupt from Active to Inactive.

**10.3.2 Behavior of the Interrupt Distributor**
When the Interrupt Distributor detects an interrupt assertion, it sets
the status of the interrupt for the targeted MP11 CPUs to Pending.
Level-triggered interrupts cannot be marked as Pending if they are
already Active for at least one MP11 CPU.
For each MP11 CPU the prioritization and selection block searches for
the Pending interrupt with the highest priority. This interrupt is then
sent with its priority to the CPU Interface.


The CPU Interface returns information to the Distributor when the CPU
acknowledges (Pending to Active transition) or clears an interrupt
(Active to Inactive transition). With the given interrupt ID, the
Interrupt Distributor updates the status of this interrupt according to
the information sent by the CPU Interface.
When an interrupt is triggered by the Software Interrupt Register or the
Set-pending Register, the status of that interrupt for the targeted CPU
or CPUs is set to Pending. This interrupt then has the same behavior as
a hardware interrupt. The distributor does not differentiate between
software and hardware triggered interrupts.
