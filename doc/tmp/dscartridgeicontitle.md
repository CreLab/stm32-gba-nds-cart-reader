# DS Cartridge Icon/Title


- The ROM offset of the Icon/Title is defined in CartHdr\[68h\]. The siz
was originally implied by the size of the original Icon/Title structure
rounded to 200h-byte sector boundary (ie. A00h bytes for Version 1 or
- 2), however, later DSi carts (with CartHdr\[1Ch\].bit0=1) are having 
- size entry at CartHdr\[208h\] (usually 23C0h).
- If present (ie. if CartHdr\[68h\]=nonzero), then Icon/Title ar
displayed in the bootmenu.

**Versions**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0001h = Original                                                |
|       0002h = With Chinese Title                                      |
|       0003h = With Chinese+Korean Titles                              |
|       0103h = With Chinese+Korean Titles and animated DSi icon        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Title Strings**
Usually, for non-multilanguage games, the same (english) title is stored
in all title entries. The title may consist of ASCII characters
0020h-007Fh, character 000Ah (linefeed), and should be terminated/padded
by 0000h.
The whole text should not exceed the dimensions of the DS cart field in
the bootmenu (the maximum number of characters differs due to
proportional font).
The title is usually split into a primary title, optional sub-title, and
manufacturer, each separated by 000Ah character(s). For example:
\"America\", 000Ah, \"The Axis of War\", 000Ah, \"Cynicware\", 0000h.

**Icon Animation Sequence (DSi)**
The sequence is represented by 16bit tokens, in the following format:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15    Flip Vertically   (0=No, 1=Yes)                           |
|       14    Flip Horizontally (0=No, 1=Yes)                           |
|       13-11 Palette Index     (0..7)                                  |
|       10-8  Bitmap Index      (0..7)                                  |
|       7-0   Frame Duration    (01h..FFh) (in 60Hz units)              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Value 0000h indicates the end of the sequence. If the first token is
0000h, then the non-animated default image is shown.
Uh, actually, a non-animated icon uses values 01h,00h,00h,01h, followed
by 7Ch zerofilled bytes (ie. 0001h, 0100h, 3Eh x 0000h)?

**FAT16:\\title\\000300tt\\4ggggggg\\data\\banner.sav ;i
- carthdr\[1BFh\].bit2=1**
Some DSi games are having a separate \"banner.sav\" file stored in th
- eMMC filesystem, enabled via carthdr\[1BFh\].bit2 (allowing to indicat
the game progress by overriding the default icon). The banner files are
4000h bytes in size, the animation data is same as above, but without
title strings and without non-animated icon.

```

|     11A0h 2E60h Garbage (random values, maybe due to eMMC decryption) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The feature is used by some Brain Age Express games (for example, Brain
Age Express Sudoku: \'title\\00030004\\4b4e3945\\data\\banner.sav\').
The feature does probably work only for DSiware titles (unless there are
any DSi carts with SD/MMC access enabled; or unless there is a feature
for storing similar data in cartridge memory).
