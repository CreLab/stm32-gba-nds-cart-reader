# BIOS Memory Copy


CpuFastSet
CpuSet

**SWI 0Ch (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - CpuFastSet**
Memory copy/fill in units of 32 bytes. Memcopy is implemented as
- repeated LDMIA/STMIA \[Rb\]!,r2-r9 instructions. Memfill as single LD
- followed by repeated STMIA \[Rb\]!,r2-r9.
After processing all 32-byte-blocks, the NDS/DSi additonally processes
the remaining words as 4-byte blocks. BUG: The NDS/DSi uses the fast
32-byte-block processing only for the first N bytes (not for the first N
words), so only the first quarter of the memory block is FAST, the
remaining three quarters are SLOWLY copied word-by-word.
The length is specifed as wordcount, ie. the number of bytes divided by
4.
On the GBA, the length should be a multiple of 8 words (32 bytes)
(otherwise the GBA is forcefully rounding-up the length). On NDS/DSi,
the length may be any number of words (4 bytes).

**SWI 0Bh (GBA/NDS7/NDS9/DSi7/DSi9) - CpuSet**
Memory copy/fill in units of 4 bytes or 2 bytes. Memcopy is implemented
- as repeated LDMIA/STMIA \[Rb\]!,r3 or LDRH/STRH r3,\[r0,r5\
instructions. Memfill as single LDMIA or LDRH followed by repeated STMIA
- \[Rb\]!,r3 or STRH r3,\[r0,r5\].
The length must be a multiple of 4 bytes (32bit mode) or 2 bytes (16bit
mode). The (half)wordcount in r2 must be length/4 (32bit mode) or
length/2 (16bit mode), ie. length in word/halfword units rather than
byte units.

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.

Note: On GBA, NDS7 and DSi7, these two functions will silently reject to
do anything if the source start or end addresses are reaching into the
BIOS area. The NDS9 and DSi9 don\'t have such read-proctections.
