# GBA Timers


The GBA includes four incrementing 16bit timers.
Timer 0 and 1 can be used to supply the sample rate for DMA sound
channel A and/or B.

**4000100h - TM0CNT_L - Timer 0 Counter/Reload (R/W)**
**4000104h - TM1CNT_L - Timer 1 Counter/Reload (R/W)**
**4000108h - TM2CNT_L - Timer 2 Counter/Reload (R/W)**
**400010Ch - TM3CNT_L - Timer 3 Counter/Reload (R/W)**
Writing to these registers initializes the \<reload\> value (but doe
not directly affect the current counter value). Reading returns the
current \<counter\> value (or the recent/frozen counter value if th
timer has been stopped).
The reload value is copied into the counter only upon following two
situations: Automatically upon timer overflows, or when the timer start
bit becomes changed from 0 to 1.
Note: When simultaneously changing the start bit from 0 to 1, and
setting the reload value at the same time (by a single 32bit I/O
operation), then the newly written reload value is recognized as new
counter value.

**4000102h - TM0CNT_H - Timer 0 Control (R/W)**
**4000106h - TM1CNT_H - Timer 1 Control (R/W)**
**400010Ah - TM2CNT_H - Timer 2 Control (R/W)**
**400010Eh - TM3CNT_H - Timer 3 Control (R/W)**

```

When Count-up Timing is enabled, the prescaler value is ignored, instead
the time is incremented each time when the previous counter overflows.
This function cannot be used for Timer 0 (as it is the first timer).
F = System Clock (16.78MHz).
