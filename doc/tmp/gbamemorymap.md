**Unused Memory Area**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|      10000000-FFFFFFFF   Not used (upper 4bits of address bus unused) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Default WRAM Usage**
By default, the 256 bytes at 03007F00h-03007FFFh in Work RAM are
reserved for Interrupt vector, Interrupt Stack, and BIOS Call Stack. The
remaining WRAM is free for whatever use (including User Stack, which is
initially located at 03007F00h).

**Address Bus Width and CPU Read/Write Access Widths**
Shows the Bus-Width, supported read and write widths, and the clock
cycles for 8/16/32bit accesses.

Timing Notes:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       *   Plus 1 cycle if GBA accesses video memory at the same time. |
|       **  Default waitstate settings, see System Control chapter.     |
|                                                                       |
|     *** Separate timings for sequential, and non-sequential accesses. |
|       One cycle equals approx. 59.59ns (ie. 16.78MHz clock).          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All memory (except GamePak SRAM) can be accessed by 16bit and 32bit
DMA.

**GamePak Memory**
Only DMA3 (and the CPU of course) may access GamePak ROM. GamePak SRAM
can be accessed by the CPU only - restricted to bytewise 8bit transfers.
The SRAM region is supposed for as external FLASH backup memory, or for
battery-backed SRAM.
For details about configuration of GamePak Waitstates, see:
- [GBA System Control](./gbasystemcontrol.md)

**VRAM, OAM, and Palette RAM Access**
These memory regions can be accessed during H-Blank or V-Blank only
(unless display is disabled by Forced Blank bit in DISPCNT register).
There is an additional restriction for OAM memory: Accesses during
H-Blank are allowed only if \'H-Blank Interval Free\' in DISPCNT is se
(which\'d reduce number of display-able OBJs though).
The CPU appears to be able to access VRAM/OAM/Palette at any time, a
waitstate (one clock cycle) being inserted automatically in case that
the display controller was accessing memory simultaneously. (Ie. unlike
as in old 8bit gameboy, the data will not get lost.)

**CPU Mode Performance**
Note that the GamePak ROM bus is limited to 16bits, thus executing ARM
instructions (32bit opcodes) from inside of GamePak ROM would result in
a not so good performance. So, it\'d be more recommended to use THUM
instruction (16bit opcodes) which\'d allow each opcode to be read a
once.
(ARM instructions can be used at best performance by copying code from
GamePak ROM into internal Work RAM)

**Data Format**
Even though the ARM CPU itself would allow to select between
Little-Endian and Big-Endian format by using an external circuit, in the
GBA no such circuit exists, and the data format is always Little-Endian.
That is, when accessing 16bit or 32bit data in memory, the least
significant bits are stored in the first byte (smallest address), and
the most significant bits in the last byte. (Ie. same as for 80x86 and
Z80 CPUs.)
