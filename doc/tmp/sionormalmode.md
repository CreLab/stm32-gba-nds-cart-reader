# SIO Normal Mode


This mode is used to communicate between two units.
Transfer rates of 256Kbit/s or 2Mbit/s can be selected, however, the
fast 2Mbit/s is intended ONLY for special hardware expansions that are
DIRECTLY connected to the GBA link port (ie. without a cable being
located between the GBA and expansion hardware). In normal cases, always
use 256Kbit/s transfer rate which provides stable results.
Transfer lengths of 8bit or 32bit may be used, the 8bit mode is the same
as for older DMG/CGB gameboys, however, the voltages for \"GB
cartridges in GBAs\" are different as for \"DMG/CGB cartridges i
DMG/CGB/GBAs\", ie. it is not possible to communicate between DMG/CG
games and GBA games.

The Start bit is automatically reset when the transfer completes, ie.
when all 8 or 32 bits are transferred, at that time an IRQ may be
generated.

**400012Ah - SIODATA8 - SIO Normal Communication 8bit Data (R/W)**
For 8bit normal mode. Contains 8bit data (only lower 8bit are used).
Outgoing data should be written to this register before starting the
transfer. During transfer, transmitted bits are shifted-out (MSB first),
and received bits are shifted-in simultaneously. Upon transfer
completion, the register contains the received 8bit value.

**4000120h - SIODATA32_L - SIO Normal Communication lower 16bit data
(R/W)**
**4000122h - SIODATA32_H - SIO Normal Communication upper 16bit data
(R/W)**
Same as above SIODATA8, for 32bit normal transfer mode respectively.
SIOCNT/RCNT must be set to 32bit normal mode \<before\> writing t
SIODATA32.

**Initialization**
First, initialize RCNT register. Second, set mode/clock bits in SIOCNT
with startbit cleared. For master: select internal clock, and (in most
cases) specify 256KHz as transfer rate. For slave: select external
clock, the local transfer rate selection is then ignored, as the
transfer rate is supplied by the remote GBA (or other computer, which
might supply custom transfer rates).
Third, set the startbit in SIOCNT with mode/clock bits unchanged.

**Recommended Communication Procedure for SLAVE unit (external clock)**
- Initialize data which is to be sent to master.
- Set Start flag.
- Set SO to LOW to indicate that master may start now.
- Wait for IRQ (or for Start bit to become zero). (Check timeout here!)
- Set SO to HIGH to indicate that we are not ready.
- Process received data.
- Repeat procedure if more data is to be transferred.
(or is so=high done automatically? would be fine - more stable -
otherwise master may still need delay)

**Recommended Communication Procedure for SLAVE unit (external clock)**
- Initialize data which is to be sent to master.
- Set Start=0 and SO=0 (SO=LOW indicates that slave is (almost) ready).
- Set Start=1 and SO=1 (SO=HIGH indicates not ready, applied after
transfer).

```

|       (Expl. Old SO=LOW kept output until 1st clock bit received).    |
|                                                                       |
|   (Expl. New SO=HIGH is automatically output at transfer completion). |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

\- Set SO to LOW to indicate that master may start now.
- Wait for IRQ (or for Start bit to become zero). (Check timeout here!)
- Process received data.
- Repeat procedure if more data is to be transferred.

**Recommended Communication Procedure for MASTER unit (internal
clock)**
- Initialize data which is to be sent to slave.
- Wait for SI to become LOW (slave ready). (Check timeout here!)
- Set Start flag.
- Wait for IRQ (or for Start bit to become zero).
- Process received data.
- Repeat procedure if more data is to be transferred.

**Cable Protocol**
During inactive transfer, the shift clock (SC) is high. The transmit
(SO) and receive (SI) data lines may be manually controlled as described
above.
When master sends SC=LOW, each master and slave must output the next
outgoing data bit to SO. When master sends SC=HIGH, each master and
slave must read out the opponents data bit from SI. This is repeated for
each of the 8 or 32 bits, and when completed SC will be kept high
again.

**Transfer Rates**
Either 256KHz or 2MHz rates can be selected for SC, so max 32KBytes
(256Kbit) or 128KBytes (2Mbit) can be transferred per second. However,
the software must process each 8bit or 32bit of transmitted data
separately, so the actual transfer rate will be reduced by the time
spent on handling each data unit.
Only 256KHz provides stable results in most cases (such like when
linking between two GBAs). The 2MHz rate is intended for special
expansion hardware (with very short wires) only.

**Using Normal mode for One-Way Multiplayer communication**
When using normal mode with multiplay-cables, data isn\'t exchange
between first and second GBA as usually. Instead, data is shifted from
first to last GBA (the first GBA receives zero, because master SI is
shortcut to GND).
This behaviour may be used for fast ONE-WAY data transfer from master to
all other GBAs. For example (3 GBAs linked):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Step         Sender      1st Recipient   2nd Recipient          |
|       Transfer 1:  DATA #0 --> UNDEF      -->  UNDEF     -->          |
|       Transfer 2:  DATA #1 --> DATA #0    -->  UNDEF     -->          |
|       Transfer 3:  DATA #2 --> DATA #1    -->  DATA #0   -->          |
|       Transfer 4:  DATA #3 --> DATA #2    -->  DATA #1   -->          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The recipients should not output any own data, instead they should
forward the previously received data to the next recipient during next
transfer (just keep the incoming data unmodified in the data register).
Due to the delayed forwarding, 2nd recipient should ignore the first
incoming data. After the last transfer, the sender must send one (or
more) dummy data unit(s), so that the last data is forwarded to the 2nd
(or further) recipient(s).
