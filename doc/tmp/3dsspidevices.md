**SPI Bus/Device 0:0 - Power Managment Device**
The old power managment SPI registers are mostly for NDS mode:
- [DS Power Management Device](./dspowermanagementdevice.md)
On 3DS, backlight and power-down are controlled via MCU.

**SPI Bus/Device 0:1 - Wifi FLASH**
This chip did contain the firmware in NDS consoles. On 3DS it does
merely contain some wifi/user settings, mostly for NDS titles.
- [DS Firmware Serial Flash Memory](./dsfirmwareserialflashmemory.md)
- [DS Firmware Header](./dsfirmwareheader.md)
- [DS Firmware Wifi Calibration Data](./dsfirmwarewificalibrationdata.md)
- [DS Firmware Wifi Internet AccessPoints](./dsfirmwarewifiinternetaccesspoints.md)
- [DS Firmware User Settings](./dsfirmwareusersettings.md)
The 3DS does additionally store wifi/user settings in a eMMC file:
- [3DS Files - Config Savegame](./3dsfilesconfigsavegame.md)

**SPI Bus/Device 0:2 - DSi Touchscreen/Sound (DSi mode)**
This SPI bus is used for accessing the TSC chip in DSi mode.
- [DSi Touchscreen/Sound Controller](./dsitouchscreensoundcontroller.md)
Touchscreen calibration points for NDS/DSi titles are in Wifi FLASH
(matched to the current NDS/DSi screen resolution, which can be
256x192pix or fullscreen; selected by holding Start+Select when starting
NDS/DSi title).

**SPI Bus/Device 1:0 - 3DS Touchscreen/Sound (3DS mode)**
This is another SPI bus wired to the TSC chip, this bus can be accessed
in 3DS mode only, giving access to the normal DSi registers, plus some
additional 3DS registers in TSC page 64h,65h,67h,FBh. These new
registers are required for activating sound output, and for reading the
Circle Pad.
- [3DS TSC, Register Summary](./3dstscregistersummary.md)
Touchscreen calibration points for 3DS titles are stored in HWCAL0/1.dat
files, that files do also include calibration data for Circle Pad, and
various initial TSC register settings.

**Cartridge SPI**
Cartridge SPI can be wired to FLASH savedata (or theoretically anything
else).
This can use 4bit SPI mode (if the chip is 4bit compatible, and if 4bit
related signals are wired up accordingly, and if the specific commands
support 4bit transfers).
