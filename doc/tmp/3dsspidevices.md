### SPI Bus/Device 0:0 - Power Managment Device
The old power managment SPI registers are mostly for NDS mode:
- [DS Power Management Device](./dspowermanagementdevice.md)
On 3DS, backlight and power-down are controlled via MCU.

### SPI Bus/Device 0:1 - Wifi FLASH
This chip did contain the firmware in NDS consoles. On 3DS it does merely contain some wifi/user settings, mostly for NDS titles.
- [DS Firmware Serial Flash Memory](./dsfirmwareserialflashmemory.md)
- [DS Firmware Header](./dsfirmwareheader.md)
- [DS Firmware Wifi Calibration Data](./dsfirmwarewificalibrationdata.md)
- [DS Firmware Wifi Internet Access Points](./dsfirmwarewifiinternetaccesspoints.md)
- [DS Firmware User Settings](./dsfirmwareusersettings.md)
The 3DS does additionally store wifi/user settings in a eMMC file:
- [3DS Files - Config Savegame](./3dsfilesconfigsavegame.md)

### SPI Bus/Device 0:2 - DSi Touchscreen/Sound (DSi mode)
This SPI bus is used for accessing the TSC chip in DSi mode.
- [DSi Touchscreen/Sound Controller](./dsitouchscreensoundcontroller.md)
Touchscreen calibration points for NDS/DSi titles are in Wifi FLASH (matched to the current NDS/DSi screen resolution, which can be 256x192pix or fullscreen; selected by holding Start+Select when starting NDS/DSi title).

### SPI Bus/Device 1:0 - 3DS Touchscreen/Sound (3DS mode)
This is another SPI bus wired to the TSC chip, this bus can be accessed in 3DS mode only, giving access to the normal DSi registers, plus some additional 3DS registers in TSC page 64h,65h,67h,FBh. These new registers are required for activating sound output, and for reading the Circle Pad.
- [3DS TSC, Register Summary](./3dstscregistersummary.md)
Touchscreen calibration points for 3DS titles are stored in HWCAL0/1.dat files, that files do also include calibration data for Circle Pad, and various initial TSC register settings.

### Cartridge SPI
Cartridge SPI can be wired to FLASH savedata (or theoretically anything else).
This can use 4bit SPI mode (if the chip is 4bit compatible, and if 4bit related signals are wired up accordingly, and if the specific commands support 4bit transfers).
