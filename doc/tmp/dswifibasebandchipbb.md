# DS Wifi Baseband Chip (BB)


BB-Chip Mitsumi MM3155 (DS), or BB/RF-Chip Mitsumi MM3218 (DS-Lite)

**4808158h - W_BB_CNT - Baseband serial transfer control (W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   Index     (00h-68h)                                       |
|       8-11  Not used  (should be zero)                                |
|       12                                                              |
| -15 Direction (5=Write BB_WRITE to Chip, 6=Read from Chip to BB_READ) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Transfer is started after writing to this register.

**480815Ah - W_BB_WRITE - Baseband serial write data (W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   Data to be sent to chip (by following W_BB_CNT transfer)  |
|       8-15  Not used (should be zero)                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**480815Ch - W_BB_READ - Baseband serial read data (R)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   Data received from chip (from previous W_BB_CNT transfer) |
|       8-15  Not used (always zero)                                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**480815Eh - W_BB_BUSY - Baseband serial busy flag (R)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     Transfer Busy (0=Ready, 1=Busy)                           |
|       1-15  Always zero                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Used to sense transfer completion after writes to W_BB_CNT.
Not sure if I am doing something wrong\... but the busy flag doesn\'
seem to get set immediately after W_BB_CNT writes, and works only after
waiting a good number of clock cycles?

**4808160h - W_BB_MODE (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   Always zero                                               |
|       8     Unknown (usually 1) (no effect no matter what setting?)   |
|       9-13  Always zero                                               |
|       14    Unknown (usually 0) (W_BB_READ gets unstable when set)    |
|       15    Always zero                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This register is initialized by firmware bootcode - don\'t change.

**4808168h - W_BB_POWER (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-3   Disable whatever   (usually 0Dh=disable)                  |
|       4-14  Always zero                                               |
|       15    Disable W_BB_ports (usually 1=Disable)                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Must be set to 0000h before accessing BB registers.

**Read-Write-Ability of the BB/RF-Chip Mitsumi MM3218 (DS-Lite)**
- Same as above. Except that reading always seems to return \[5Dh\]=00h
And, for whatever reason, Nintendo initializes DS-Lite registers by
- writing \[00h\]=03h and \[66h\]=12h. Nethertheless, the registers alway
- read as \[00h\]=6Dh and \[66h\]=00h, ie. same as on original DS.

**Important BB Registers**
Registers 0..68h are initialized by firmware bootcode, and (most) of
these settings do not need to be changed by other programs, except for:
