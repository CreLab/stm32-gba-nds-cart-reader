# 3DS Files - Title Ticket (ticket.db)


### 3ds:\\dbs\\ticket.db (about 35.5Mbytes) (237F600h bytes)
ticket.db is a DIFF container containing a short 10h-byte header followed by a BDRI filesystem.
- [3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF](./3dsfilessavedatadisaanddiff.md)
- [3DS Files - Savedata SAVE/BDRI/VSXE Formats](./3dsfilessavedatasavebdrivsxeformats.md)
The 10h-byte header (between DIFF and BDRI layer) looks as so:

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 8    ID "TICK",01h,00h,00h,00h                                       |
|       008h 4    Garbage (eg. random, or 0)                                      |
|       00Ch 4    Garbage (eg. random-30h, or 1)                                  |
|       010h ...  BDRI filesystem (about 17Mbytes) (10A2000h) (with ticket files) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The BDRI can contain up to 8192 files, usually it does contain about 200 tickets for the system titles, including the DSiware titles, plus any further tickets for titles purchased from e-Shop (no matter if the titles are stored on eMCC or on SD Cards).

Tickets are a format used to store an encrypted titlekey (using AES-CBC). With 3DS, the Ticket format was updated (now v1) from Wii/DSi format (v0).

```

\* The Content Index of a ticket has its own size defined within itself (usually ACh), with seemingly a minimal of 20 bytes.

The \"Content Index\" (whatever that is) at 2A4h looks as so:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

### Signature Type

+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The hash for the signature is calculated over the Ticket Data.

The Ticket Title Version is generally the same as the title version stored in the Title Metadata. Although it doesn\'t have to match the TMD version to be valid.

### TitleKey (for decrypting .app\'s in CIA\'s or Shop downloads)
First of, decrypt the ticket\'s Title Key via AES-CBC:

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       dev/retail      = can be detected from RSA Signature Name at TIK[140h]       |
|       KEY_X[00h..0Fh] = Keyslot 3Dh, as set by bootrom (differs for retail/dev)    |
|       KEY_Y[00h..0Fh] = common key(0..5) from FIRM, index 0..5 from TIK[1F1h]      |
|       KEY[00h..0Fh]   = derived from above KeyX/Y (retail key0..5 and dev key1..5) |
|       KEY[00h..0Fh]   = fixed normal key from FIRM (special, for dev key0 only)    |
|       IV[00h..07h]    = Title ID (big-endian), from TIK[1DCh]                      |
|       IV[08h..0Fh]    = Zero                                                       |
|       SRC[00h..0Fh]   = Encrypted Title Key, from TIK[1BFh]                        |
|       aes-cbc decrypt                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Then use the decrypted key to decrypt the .app via AES-CBC:

```
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       KEY[00h..0Fh]   = Decrypted title key (decrypted from ticket)        |
|       IV[00h..01h]    = Content Index (big endian, from TMD[B04h+N*30h+4]) |
|       IV[02h..0Fh]    = Zero                                               |
|       SIZE            = Content Size (from TMD[B04h+N*30h+8])              |
|       aes-cbc decrypt (unless TMD[B04h+N*30h+6] has flagged encryption=0)  |
+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: For AES-CBC random access, one can use the preceeding \"encrypted 10h-byte block\" as IV value (except, use the above IV for first block).
Unknown if there is a dev/retail flag in the ticket (if not, then one could
instead check the RSA Signature Name; retail=\"Root-CA00000003-XS0000000c\")

### Limits
In demos, the first u32 in the \"Limits\" section is 0x4, then the second u32 is the max-playcount.

### Certificate Chain
Tickets retrieved from CDN/SOAP have a certificate chain appended at the end of the file. There are two certificates in this chain:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       CERTIFICATE SIG.TYPE  RETAIL CERT  DEBUG CERT  DESCRIPTION                  |
|       Ticket      RSA-2048  XS0000000c   XS00000009  to verify Ticket signature   |
|       CA          RSA-4096  CA00000003   CA00000004  to verify Ticket Certificate |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The CA certificate is issued by \'Root\', the public key for which is stored in NATIVE_FIRM.

### Notes
CommonETicket (for short, cetk) is the name given to tickets for titles which are not available on the eShop, like system titles. As the name suggests, they are not unique tickets, the same ticket is common to each 3ds which has installed that title. This is in contrast to tickets for eShop content, which are generated prior to initial download, and are unique to 3ds it was generated for.
CETK can be fetched through HTTP using the link to default update server, using the title\'s TMD URL where \"cetk\" is used instead of \"tmd\" for the URL. The 3DS NIM module retrieves system tickets via SOAP request GetSystemCommonETicket instead of directly downloading the cetks with HTTPS. The cetks are also accessible via HTTP (even though the 3DS never accesses them like that).

### Other Ticket files/folders
Apart from ticket.db, there is a 4B000h-byte file called 3ds:\\tmp\\title.tik containing the following stuff:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000h 350h    Ticket (without 8-byte header)    ;-350h-byte ticket            |

|       03F0h 88h     Unknown (00h-filled)              ;/                    ; 128h  |
|       0478h 9Ch     Unknown (00h-filled)              ;\                    ; byte

|       0518h 88h     Unknown (00h-filled)              ;/                    ;       |
|       ...   48*128h ...                               ;-128h-byte's as above;/      |
|       3D20h 0B8h    Unknown (00h-filled)              ;\                            
|       3DD8h 4       Unknown (52h,46h,00h,00h)         ; whatever                    |
|       3DDCh 4       Unknown (58h,A8h,07h,00h)         ;                             |
|       3DE0h 4       Unknown (B4h,32h,15h,00h)         ;/                            |
|       3DE4h 4721Ch  Unknown (00h-filled)              ;-lots of zeroes              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Additionally, there are two empty ticket folders:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3ds:\ticket\     ;on 3DS partition                              
|       dsi:\ticket\     ;on DSi partition                              
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The latter would have been used on DSi to store .tik files (but the 3DS does instead store all tickets in ticket.db, including DSiware tickets).
