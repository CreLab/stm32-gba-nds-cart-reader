# 3DS Files - Title Ticket (ticket.db)


**3ds:\\dbs\\ticket.db (about 35.5Mbytes) (237F600h bytes)**
ticket.db is a DIFF container containing a short 10h-byte header
followed by a BDRI filesystem.
- [3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF](./3dsfilessavedatadisaanddiff.md)
- [3DS Files - Savedata SAVE/BDRI/VSXEFormats](./3dsfilessavedatasavebdrivsxeformats.md)
The 10h-byte header (between DIFF and BDRI layer) looks as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 8    ID "TICK",01h,00h,00h,00h                             |
|       008h 4    Garbage (eg. random, or 0)                            |
|       00Ch 4    Garbage (eg. random-30h, or 1)                        |
|       010h                                                            |
|  ...  BDRI filesystem (about 17Mbytes) (10A2000h) (with ticket files) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The BDRI can contain up to 8192 files, usually it does contain about 200
tickets for the system titles, including the DSiware titles, plus any
further tickets for titles purchased from e-Shop (no matter if the
titles are stored on eMCC or on SD Cards).

Tickets are a format used to store an encrypted titlekey (using
AES-CBC). With 3DS, the Ticket format was updated (now v1) from Wii/DSi
format (v0).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

\* The Content Index of a ticket has its own size defined within itsel
(usually ACh), with seemingly a minimal of 20 bytes.

The \"Content Index\" (whatever that is) at 2A4h looks as so:

```

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The hash for the signature is calculated over the Ticket Data.

The Ticket Title Version is generally the same as the title version
stored in the Title Metadata. Although it doesn\'t have to match the TM
version to be valid.

**TitleKey (for decrypting .app\'s in CIA\'s or Shop downloads)**
First of, decrypt the ticket\'s Title Key via AES-CBC:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       d                                                               |
- | ev/retail      = can be detected from RSA Signature Name at TIK[140h] |
|       KEY_                                                            |
- | X[00h..0Fh] = Keyslot 3Dh, as set by bootrom (differs for retail/dev) |
|       KE                                                              |
- | Y_Y[00h..0Fh] = common key(0..5) from FIRM, index 0..5 from TIK[1F1h] |
- |       KEY[00h                                                         |
| ..0Fh]   = derived from above KeyX/Y (retail key0..5 and dev key1..5) |
- |       KEY[                                                            |
| 00h..0Fh]   = fixed normal key from FIRM (special, for dev key0 only) |
- |       IV[00h..07h]    = Title ID (big-endian), from TIK[1DCh]         |
- |       IV[08h..0Fh]    = Zero                                          |
- |       SRC[00h..0Fh]   = Encrypted Title Key, from TIK[1BFh]           |
|       aes-cbc decrypt                                                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Then use the decrypted key to decrypt the .app via AES-CBC:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       KEY[00h..0Fh]   = Decrypted title key (decrypted from ticket)   |
|                                                                       |
- |  IV[00h..01h]    = Content Index (big endian, from TMD[B04h+N*30h+4]) |
- |       IV[02h..0Fh]    = Zero                                          |
- |       SIZE            = Content Size (from TMD[B04h+N*30h+8])         |
|                                                                       |
- |   aes-cbc decrypt (unless TMD[B04h+N*30h+6] has flagged encryption=0) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: For AES-CBC random access, one can use the preceeding \"encrypte
10h-byte block\" as IV value (except, use the above IV for firs
block).
Unknown if there is a dev/retail flag in the ticket (if not, then one
could
instead check the RSA Signature Name;
retail=\"Root-CA00000003-XS0000000c\")

**Limits**
In demos, the first u32 in the \"Limits\" section is 0x4, then th
second u32 is the max-playcount.

**Certificate Chain**
Tickets retrieved from CDN/SOAP have a certificate chain appended at the
end of the file. There are two certificates in this chain:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       CERTIFICATE SIG.TYPE  RETAIL CERT  DEBUG CERT  DESCRIPTION      |
|       Tick                                                            |
| et      RSA-2048  XS0000000c   XS00000009  to verify Ticket signature |
|       CA                                                              |
|       RSA-4096  CA00000003   CA00000004  to verify Ticket Certificate |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The CA certificate is issued by \'Root\', the public key for which i
stored in NATIVE_FIRM.

**Notes**
CommonETicket (for short, cetk) is the name given to tickets for titles
which are not available on the eShop, like system titles. As the name
suggests, they are not unique tickets, the same ticket is common to each
3ds which has installed that title. This is in contrast to tickets for
eShop content, which are generated prior to initial download, and are
unique to 3ds it was generated for.
CETK can be fetched through HTTP using the link to default update
server, using the title\'s TMD URL where \"cetk\" is used instead o
\"tmd\" for the URL. The 3DS NIM module retrieves system tickets vi
SOAP request GetSystemCommonETicket instead of directly downloading the
cetks with HTTPS. The cetks are also accessible via HTTP (even though
the 3DS never accesses them like that).

**Other Ticket files/folders**
Apart from ticket.db, there is a 4B000h-byte file called
3ds:\\tmp\\title.tik containing the following stuff:

Additionally, there are two empty ticket folders:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3ds:\ticket\     ;on 3DS partition                              
|       dsi:\ticket\     ;on DSi partition                              
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The latter would have been used on DSi to store .tik files (but the 3DS
does instead store all tickets in ticket.db, including DSiware
tickets).
