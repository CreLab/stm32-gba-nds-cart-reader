Changes the byte order for data access to Big/Little endian. Does
probably not affect opcode fetches, but probably affect all other memory
including push/pop? Or affects \"LDR\" only?
Supported on ARMv6 and above.

**Store Return State (SRS) (stores the R14 and SPSR of the current
mode)**
to the word at the specified address and the following word
respectively. The address is determined from the banked version of R13
belonging to a specified mode.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Syntax                                                          |
|       SRS<addressing_mode> #<mode>{!}   ;<-- original (pre-UAL)       |
|       SRS<addressing_mode> sp!,#<mode>  ;<-- more common (UAL)        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

\<addressing_mode\>: Is similar to the \<addressing_mode\> in LDM an
STM instructions, see Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on
page A5-41, but with the following differences:
- The base register, Rn, is the banked version of R13 for the mode
specified by \<mode\>, rather than the current mode.
- The number of registers to store is 2.
- The register list is {R14, SPSR}, with both R14 and the SPSR being the
versions belonging to the current mode.
\<mode\> Specifies the number of the mode whose banked register is use
as the base register for \<addressing_mode\>. The mode number is th
5-bit encoding of the chosen mode in a PSR, as described in The mode
bits on page A2-14.
! If present, sets the W bit. This causes the instruction to write a
modified value back to its base register, in a manner similar to that
specified for Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on page A5-41.
If ! is omitted, the W bit is 0 and the instruction does not change the
base register.

**Return From Exception (RFE) (RFEDA, RFEDB, RFEIA, RFEIB)**
loads the PC and the CPSR from the word at the specified address and
the
following word respectively.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Syntax                                                          |
|       RFE<addressing_mode> Rn{!}                                      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

\<addressing_mode\>: Is similar to the \<addressing_mode\> in LDM an
STM instructions, see Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on
page A5-41, but with the following differences:
- The number of registers to load is 2.
- The register list is {PC, CPSR}.
\<Rn\> Specifies the base register to be used by \<addressing_mode\>. I
R15 is specified as the base register, the result is UNPREDICTABLE.
! If present, sets the W bit. This causes the instruction to write a
modified value back to its base register, in a manner similar to that
specified for Addressing Mode 4 - Load and Store Multiple on page A5-41.
If ! is omitted, the W bit is 0 and the instruction does not change the
base register.
While RFE supports different base registers, a general usage case is
where Rn == sp (the stack pointer), held in R13. The instruction can
then be used as the return method associated with instructions SRS and
CPS. See New instructions to improve exception handling on page A2-28
for more details.

**SVC (formerly SWI)**
SWI was renamed to SVC in new UAL syntax.

```

The alias was invented in ARMv6 for THUMB and ARM code (apparently
because pre-UAL THUMB syntax couldn\'t distinguish between MOV and MOVS
(ie. in ARM it\'s useless, but in THUMB it does allow using a formerl
undocumented opcode).
ARMv6 and above.
