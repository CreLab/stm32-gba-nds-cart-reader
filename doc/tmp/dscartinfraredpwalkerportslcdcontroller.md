# DS Cart Infrared P-Walker Ports LCD Controller


**LCD Command Table**
Commands are 1 or 2 bytes long (with D/C=Low, and, unlike normal SPI,
one can release /CS after each byte, even when sending 2-byte
commands).

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**VRAM Writing**
First set the VRAM address using three commands with D/C=Low:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h+(xloc) AND 0Fh     ;Set Column Address bit0-3               |
|       10h+(xloc/10h)         ;Set Column Address bit4-6               |
|                                                                       |
|  B0h+(yloc/8)           ;Set Page Address (00h..0Ah, other=reserved?) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For the actual data transfer, set D/C=High and write data (each two
bytes contain vertical 8-pixel columns, with bit0=top, bit7=bottom):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       1st by                                                          |
| te = bitplane 1   ;\color 0..3 are usually white, lgray, dgray, black 
|       2nd                                                             |
| byte = bitplane 0   ;/(palette can be changed via cmd 88h-8Fh though) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: Column Address (xloc) is auto-incremented after each byte pair,
the Page Address (yloc) is NOT incremented when wrapping from x=7Fh to
x=00h.
The last page is the \"icon\", this has only 1 pixel per xloc, mayb
intended to enable special symbols instead of pixels (on displays to
combine symbols and pixels).

**VRAM Reading and Status Byte (both supported in parallel Non-SPI mode
only)**
The controller supports four modes (Nintendo uses the 4-wire SPI mode):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       3-wire                                                          |
|  SPI Serial write-only (/CS, CLK, MOSI, with cmd E8h instead D/C pin) |
|       4-wire SPI Serial write-only (/CS, CLK, MOSI, D/C=Data/Cmd)     |

VRAM can be read setting the VRAM address as usually, and then reading
with D/C=High. And, an 8bit status byte can be read with D/C=Low:

```

|       6    ON      Display is On/Off             (0=Off, 1=On)        |

**Note**
Nintendo uses a 96x64 pixel grayscale LCD screen with 2bpp, without
backlight or frontlight. VRAM is double buffered (VRAM size is at least
96x128 pixels).
The display controller seems to be a Solomon System SSD1850 chip\... o
similar, there are a number of datasheets that are more or less matching
the LCD commands used in the firmware:

```

|       SSD085                                                          |
| 2  128x128 would allow double-buffer, but extended commands are wrong |
|       SSD0858  104x65  close, but extended commands are wrong         |
|       SSD0859  128x81  could be correct (almost same as SSD1850)      |
|       SSD1820  128x65  wrong, lacks palette (command 88h-8Fh)         |
|       SSD1820A 128x65  wrong, lacks palette (command 88h-8Fh)         |
|       SSD1821  128x81  wrong, lacks palette (command 88h-8Fh)         |
|       SSD1                                                            |
| 850  128x65  could be correct (ysiz is good, but no double-buffering) |
|       SSD1851  128x81  as above, but more lines than needed           |
|       SSD185                                                          |

|            (also cmd 18h,20h,4xh,50h,60h-63h,64h,82h,83h,etc. differ) |
|       SSD1858  104x65  close, but lacks many extended commands        |
|       SSD1859  128x81  could be correct (almost same as SSD1850)      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

But, Nintendo\'s firmware contains extended command F7h,02h (whic
isn\'t mentioned in any of the above datasheets).
And, the firmware seems to use two 64-line framebuffers at
DisplayStart=0 and DisplayStart=64, ie. needing 128 lines in total,
which leaves no space for the \"icon\" scanline (at least no
addressable via cmd B0h+y).
