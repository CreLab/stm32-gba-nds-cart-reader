- \[2\] These bits in can only be modified if register bit EFR\[4\] i
enabled.
- \[5\] After Receive FIFO or Transmit FIFO reset (through FCR\[1:0\])
the user must wait at least 2\' ??? Tclk of XTAL1 before reading o
writing data to RHR and THR, respectively.
- \[8\] IrDA mode slow/fast for SC16IS760, slow only for SC16IS750.

- **IR\[00h.DLAB=0.R\] - RHR - Receive Holding Register (R)**
The receiver section consists of the Receiver Holding Register (RHR) and
the Receiver Shift Register (RSR). The RHR is actually a 64-byte FIFO.
The RSR receives serial data from the RX pin. The data is converted to
parallel data and moved to the RHR. The receiver section is controlled
by the Line Control Register. If the FIFO is disabled, location zero of
the FIFO is used to store the characters.

- **IR\[00h.DLAB=0.W\] - THR - Transmit Holding Register (W)**
The transmitter section consists of the Transmit Holding Register (THR)
and the Transmit Shift Register (TSR). The THR is actually a 64-byte
FIFO. The THR receives data and shifts it into the TSR, where it is
converted to serial data and moved out on the TX pin. If the FIFO is
disabled, the FIFO is still used to store the byte. Characters are lost
if overflow occurs.

|       7-6  Trigger level for the RX FIFO (0..3 = 8,16,56,60 chars)    |

|       0    RX/TX FIFO enable (0=Disable, 1=Enable)                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bit1,2: FIFO reset requires at least two XTAL1 clocks, therefore, they
cannot be reset without the presence of the XTAL1 clock.
- Bit4-5: Can only be modified and enabled when EFR\[4\] is set. This i
because the transmit trigger level is regarded as an enhanced function.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Bit2-4 reflect the error bits (BI, FE, PE) of the character at the top
of the RX FIFO (next character to be read). Therefore, errors in a
character are identified by reading the LSR and then reading the RHR.

Burst reads on the serial interface should not be performed on the IIR
register (ie. don\'t read multiple elements on the I2C-bus without 
STOP or repeated START condition, and don\'t read multiple elements o
the SPI bus without de-asserting the CS pin).

receive FIFO trigger levels. Trigger levels from 4 characters to 60
characters are available with a granularity of four. The TLR should be
programmed for NÏ4, where N is the desired trigger level.
When the trigger level setting in TLR is zero, the SC16IS740/750/760
uses the trigger level setting defined in FCR. If TLR has non-zero
trigger level value, the trigger level defined in FCR is discarded. This
applies to both transmit FIFO and receive FIFO trigger level setting.
- When TLR is used for RX trigger level control, FCR\[7:6\] should be lef
at the default state, that is, \'00\'.

This register is only available on the SC16IS750 and SC16IS760.
Remark: As I/O pins, the direction, state, and interrupt of GPIO4-7 are
controlled by the following registers: IODir, IOState, IOIntEna, and
IOControl. The state of CD, RI, DSR pins will not be reflected in
- MSR\[7:5\] or MSR\[3:1\], and any change of state on these three pin
will not trigger a modem status interrupt (even if enabled via
- IER\[3\]), and the state of the DTR pin cannot be controlled b
- MCR\[0\].
As modem CD, RI, DSR pins, the status at the input of these three pins
- can be read from MSR\[7:5\] and MSR\[3:1\], and the state of DTR pin ca
- be controlled by MCR\[0\]. Also, if modem status interrupt bit i
- enabled, IER\[3\], a change of state of RI, CD, DSR pins will trigger 
- modem interrupt. Bit\[7:4\] of the IODir, IOState, and IOIntEn
registers will not have any effect on these three pins.

**Infrared Usage in 3DS**
The 3DS doesn\'t have any expansion connector, and it\'s instead usin
the IrDA port for expansion hardware (with external batteries):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - Circle                                                         |
|  Pad Pro (a second Circle Pad, attached right of the A/B/X/Y buttons) |
|      - NFC Near-field communication (for Amiibo figures)              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For the NFC thing, see here:
- [3DS NFC Adapter](./3dsnfcadapter.md)
That add-on hardware exists for Old3DS only. The New3DS does have
equivalent hardware built-in, and thus doesn\'t need that add-ons.
The IrDA port could theoretically communicate with old NDS pedometers
(Activity Meter and P-Walker), there isn\'t any known 3DS softwar
supporting that though (and the 3DS has its own pedometer built-in
anyways, although it\'s a bit clumsy to carry the whole console).
Additionally, IrDA could be reportedly used for things like file
transfers, unknown if there are 3DS tools supporting such things?

**Infrared Signals**
The SC16IS750 UART/IrDA SIR datasheet does mainly describe the UART
part, and barely mentions infrared at all (apart from saying that the
chip is IrDA SIR compatible, and that IrDA can be enabled in MCR.bit6).
Going by other sources, IrDA SIR works like \"UART over infrared\". I
lack of further details, here are some guesses on how it might work (and
how far it is (or isn\'t) compatible with regular cable-based UARTs):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - RX/TX a                                                        |
| re probably using pulsed signals instead of constant LOW/HIGH levels? |
|      - RTS/CTS/DTR/DSR are probably not implemented at all?           |
|      - Simulta                                                        |
| neous RX+TX might work in opposite light-direction, if no reflection? |
|      - In                                                             |
| frared interruptions and noise may require additional error checking? |
|      - Infrar                                                         |

However, it\'s unknown if Nintendo did bother to follow the IrD
standard in their Circle Pad Pro and NFC add-ons. It\'s also possibl
that they have just used a custom UART-like transfer protocol for that
hardware.

**Infrared Range**
IrDA is supposed for short-range transfers (about 20cm - 100cm) in
binary format. As such, it isn\'t intended to use the hardware fo
things like classic TV remote controls (although\... maybe it could b
tweaked to output TV remote signals on TX pin\... possibly in UART mod
with IrDA disabled?).
