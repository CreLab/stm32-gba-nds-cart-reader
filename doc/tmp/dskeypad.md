# DS Keypad


For the GBA-buttons: Same as GBA, both ARM7 and ARM9 have keyboard input
registers, and each its own keypad IRQ control register.

The Hinge stuff is a magnetic sensor somewhere underneath of the
Start/Select buttons (NDS) or between A/B/X/Y buttons (DSi), it will be
triggered by the magnet field from the right speaker when the console is
closed. The hinge generates an interrupt request (there seems to be no
way to disable this, unlike as for all other IRQ sources), however, the
interrupt execution can be disabled in IE register (as for other IRQ
sources).
The Pen Down is the /PENIRQ signal from the Touch Screen Controller
(TSC), if it is enabled in the TSC control register, then it will notify
the program when the screen pressed, the program should then read data
from the TSC (if there\'s no /PENIRQ then doing unneccassary TSC read
would just waste CPU power). However, the user may release the screen
before the program performs the TSC read, so treat the screen as not
pressed if you get invalid TSC values (even if /PENIRQ was LOW).
Not sure if the TSC /PENIRQ is actually triggering an IRQ in the NDS?
The Debug Button should be connected to R03 and GND (on original NDS,
R03 is the large soldering point between the SL1 jumper and the VR1
potentiometer) (there is no R03 signal visible on the NDS-Lite board).
Interrupts are reportedly not supported for X,Y buttons.
