# 3DS Files - FIRM Versions


### New3DS ARM9 kernel - weird blurb
The only actual code-difference for the Old3DS/New3DS ARM9-kernels\' crt0, besides TWL AES / 10012000h (=OTP?) related code, is that the New3DS ARM9-kernel writes 1 to REG_EXTMEMCNT9 (=CFG9_EXTMEMCNT9?) in the crt0 (unknown what crt0 means, elsewhere it\'s said that \"0xffff8000 is crt0\", although that does actually more look like a ROM address).

### New3DS Process9
The following is all of the differences for Old3DS/New3DS Process9 with 9.3.0-X:
The FIRM-launch code called at the end of the New3DS proc9 main() has different mem-range checks.
In the New3DS proc9, the v6.0/v7.0 keyinit function at the very beginning (before the original code) had additional code added for setting CTRNAND keyslot 0x5, with keydata from .data. After setting the keyY, the keyY in .data is cleared.
In New3DS proc9, the functions for getting the gamecard crypto keyslots / NCCH keyslot can return New3DS keyslots when New3DS flags (NCSD/NCCH) are set.
The code/data for the binary near the end of arm9mem is slightly different, because of memory-region sizes.
The only difference in .data (besides the above code binary) is that the New3DS proc9 has an additional 0x10-byte block for the keyslot 0x5 keyY, see above.

### Variations
There exists different official firmwares for the 3DS: The default one (NATIVE_FIRM) is used to run all 3DS content and boots by default, while backwards compatibility is handled by TWL_FIRM and AGB_FIRM. There furthermore is a rescue mode provided by SAFE_MODE_FIRM.

### NATIVE_FIRM
NATIVE_FIRM is the FIRM which is installed to the NAND firm partitions, which is loaded by bootrom.

```

Note: The above \"builder\" strings seem to be the actual Month/Day built-date.

### SAFE_MODE_FIRM
SAFE_MODE is used for running the System Updater. SAFE_MODE_FIRM and NATIVE_FIRM for the initial versions are exactly the same, except for the system core version fields.

### TWL_FIRM
TWL_FIRM handles DS(i) backwards compatibility.
The 3DS-mode ARM9 core seems to switch into DSi-mode (for running DSi-mode ARM9 code) by writing to a PDN register (this changes the memory layout to DSi-mode / etc, therefore this register poke \*must\* be executed from ITCM). This is the final 3DS-mode register poke before the ARM9 switches into DSi-mode. DS(i)-mode ARM7 code is run on the internal ARM7 core, which is started up during TWL_FIRM boot. Trying to read from the exception-vector region (address 0x0) under this DSi-mode ARM7 seems to only return 0x00/0xFF data. Also note that this DSi-mode ARM7 runs code (stored in TWL_FIRM) which pokes some DSi-mode registers that on the DSi were used for disabling access to the DSi bootROMs, however these registers do not affect the 3DS DSi-mode ARM9/ARM7 \"bootrom\" region (exceptionvector region + 0x8000) at all.

For shutting down the system, TWL_FIRM writes MCU\[20h\]=08h. For returning to 3DS-mode, TWL_FIRM writes to MCU\[20h\]=04h to trigger a hardware system reboot.

The TWL_FIRM ARM11-process includes a TWL bootloader, see here(?) and here(?) for details.

TWL_FIRM verifies all TWL RSA padding with the following. This is different from the DSi \"BIOS\" code.
The first byte must be 0x0.
The second byte must be 0x1 or 0x2.
Executes a while(\<value of byte at current pos in RSA message\>). When the second_byte in the message is 0x1, the byte at curpos must be 0xFF (otherwise the non-zero value of the byte at curpos doesn\'t matter). This loop must find a zero byte before offset 0x7F in the message otherwise an error is returned.
Returns an address for msg_curpos+1.

totalhashdatasize = rsasig_bytesize - above position in the message for the hashdata. The actual \"totalhashdatasize\" in the RSA message must be \<= \<expected hashdata_size\>(0x74 for bootloader). Uh, \<=\<\>()??? The TWL_FIRM code copies the RSA \"hashdata\" to the output buffer, using the actual size of the RSA \"hashdata\".

### AGB_FIRM
AGB_FIRM handles running GBA VC titles. The ARM9 FIRM section for TWL_FIRM and AGB_FIRM are exactly the same (for TWL_FIRM and AGB_FIRM versions which were updated with the same system-update).
