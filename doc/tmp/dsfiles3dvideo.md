# DS Files - 3D Video


Some NDS games are using the following set of files for 3D Models:
- [DS Files - 3D Video BMD0 (.NSBMD ModelData)](./dsfiles3dvideobmd0nsbmdmodeldata.md)
- [DS Files - 3D Video BTX0 (.NSBTX TextureData)](./dsfiles3dvideobtx0nsbtxtexturedata.md)
- [DS Files - 3D Video BCA0 (.NSBCA Character SkeletalAnimation)](./dsfiles3dvideobca0nsbcacharacterskeletalanimation.md)
- [DS Files - 3D Video BTA0 (.NSBTA Texture CoordinateAnimation)](./dsfiles3dvideobta0nsbtatexturecoordinateanimation.md)
- [DS Files - 3D Video BTP0 (.NSBTP Texture PatternAnimation)](./dsfiles3dvideobtp0nsbtptexturepatternanimation.md)
- [DS Files - 3D Video BMA0 (.NSBMA MaterialAnimation)](./dsfiles3dvideobma0nsbmamaterialanimation.md)
- [DS Files - 3D Video NVA0 (.NSBVA Unknown VisAnimation)](./dsfiles3dvideonva0nsbvaunknownvisanimation.md)
The format was used in Nintendo\'s own titles somewhere between 2005 an
2009 (older launch titles did use an older .bin or .bxx format instead
of .nsbxx format, and later mini-games often don\'t support 3D video a
all, and third-party games tend to use their own formats). Some known
titles that do use .nsbxx are:

|       type BMD0/BCA0/BTA0 is used by Walk with Me (2008-2009)         |
|       type BVA0 is used by what... if it was ever used?               |

```

Note: The format resembles the later CGFX format used on 3DS.

The Patricia Tree is intended for searching Symbols by testing a few
bits (without comparing all characters).
The Data content depends on what the Dict is used for. Each name can
have a small amount of data stored inside of the Dict (and, that Data
may contain offsets to larger data stored elsewhere).
