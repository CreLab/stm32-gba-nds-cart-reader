# About this Document


**About**
GBATEK written 2001-2014 by Martin Korth, programming specs for the GBA
and NDS hardware, I\'ve been trying to keep the specs both as short a
possible, and as complete as possible. The document is part of the
no\$gba debuggers built-in help text.

**Updates**
The standalone docs in TXT and HTM format are updated when having added
any major changes to the document. The no\$gba built-in version will b
updated more regularly, including for minor changes, along with all
no\$gba updates.
