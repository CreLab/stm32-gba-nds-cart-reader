# About this Document


### About
GBATEK written 2001-2014 by Martin Korth, programming specs for the GBA and NDS hardware, I\'ve been trying to keep the specs both as short as possible, and as complete as possible. The document is part of the no\$gba debuggers built-in help text.

### Updates
The standalone docs in TXT and HTM format are updated when having added any major changes to the document. The no\$gba built-in version will be updated more regularly, including for minor changes, along with all no\$gba updates.
