# DS 3D Polygon Definitions by Vertices


The DS supports polygons with 3 or 4 edges, triangles and quadliterals.
The position of the edges is defined by vertices, each consisting of
(x,y,z) values.

For Line Segments, use Triangles with twice the same vertex, Line
Segments are rendered always because they do not have any front and back
sides.
The Prohibited Quad shapes may produce unintended results, namely, that
are Quads with crossed sides, and quads with angles greater than 180
degrees.

The vertices are normally arranged anti-clockwise, except that: in
triangle-strips each second polygon uses clockwise arranged vertices,
and quad-strips are sorts of \"up-down\" arranged (whereas \"up\" an
\"down\" may be anywhere due to rotation). Other arrangements may resul
in quads with crossed lines, or may swap the front and back sides of the
polygon (above examples are showing the front sides).

**4000500h - Cmd 40h - BEGIN_VTXS - Start of Vertex List (W)**

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Parameter 1, Bit 0-1    Primitive Type (0..3, see below)        |
|       Parameter 1, Bit 2-31   Not used                                |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Indicates the Start of a Vertex List, and its Primitive Type:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0  Separate Triangle(s)    ;3*N vertices per N triangles        |
|       1  Separate Quadliteral(s) ;4*N vertices per N quads            |
|       2  Triangle Strips         ;3+(N-1) vertices per N triangles    |
|       3  Quadliteral Strips      ;4+(N-1)*2 vertices per N quads      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The BEGIN_VTX command should be followed by VTX\_-commands to define th
Vertices of the list, and should be then terminated by END_VTX command.
BEGIN_VTX additionally applies changes to POLYGON_ATTR.

**4000504h - Cmd 41h - END_VTXS - End of Vertex List (W)**
Parameters: None. This is a Dummy command for OpenGL compatibility. It
should be used to terminate a BEGIN_VTX, VTX\_\<values\> sequence
END_VTXS is possibly required for Nintendo\'s software emulator? On rea
NDS consoles (and in no\$gba) it does have no effect, it can be lef
out, or can be issued multiple times inside of a vertex list, without
disturbing the display.

```

Sets XYZ-Coordinate relative to the XYZ-Coordinates from previous VTX.
In detail: The 9bit fractional values are divided by 8 (sign expanded to
12bit fractions, in range +/-0.125), and that 12bit fraction is then
added to the old vtx coordinates. The result of the addition should not
overflow 16bit vertex coordinate range (1bit sign, 3bit integer, 12bit
fraction).

**Notes on VTX commands**
On each VTX command, the viewport coordinates of the vertex are
calculated and stored in Vertex RAM,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ( xx, yy, zz, ww ) = ( x, y, z, 1.0 ) * ClipMatrix              |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The actual screen position (in pixels) is then,

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       screen_x = (xx+ww)*viewport_width / (2*ww) + viewport_x1        |
|       screen_y = (yy+ww)*viewport_height / (2*ww) + viewport_y1       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Each VTX command that completes the definition of a polygon (ie. each
3rd for Separate Trangles) does additionally store data in Polygon List
RAM.
VTX commands may be issued only between Begin and End commands.

**Clipping**
Polygons are clipped to the 6 sides of the view volume (ie. to the left,
right, top, bottom, near, and far edges). If one or more vertic(es)
exceed one of these sides, then these vertic(es) are replaced by two
newly created vertices (which are located on the intersections of the
polygon edges and the view volume edge).
Depending on the number of clipped vertic(es), this may increase or
decrease the number of entries in Vertex RAM (ie. minus N clipped
vertices, plus 2 new vertices). Also, clipped polygons which are part of
polygon strips are converted to separate polygons (which does increase
number of entries in Vertex RAM). Polygons that are fully outside of the
View Volume aren\'t stored in Vertex RAM, nor in Polygon RAM (the onl
exception are polygons that are located exactly one pixel below of, or
right of lower/right edges, which appear to be accidently stored in
memory).
