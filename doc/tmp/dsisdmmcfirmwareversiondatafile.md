# DSi SD/MMC Firmware Version Data File


verdata (00030005-HNLx) is a bundle of data which corresponds to a
release of the \"System Menu\" \-- every time Nintendo announces a ne
version of the system menu, they will update one or more other titles
and then update this title. The verdata filesize is constant for all
versions/regions (1B50h bytes). Existing verdata downloads on
Nintendo\'s server are:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00000001..00000009  jpn         (9 versions)                    |
|       00000003..00000009  usa/eur/aus (7 versions)                    |
|       00000001..00000006  chn         (6 versions)                    |
|       00000002..00000006  kor         (5 versions)                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Apart from those downloads/updates, each region did probably originally
have an older version pre-installed. The japanese 1.0J firmware did
oddly have 00000000.app files for BOTH japan and usa?/aus? installed
(whereof the latter contained 0.1A instead of 1.0A as version string).

|       0080h ...  NARC (Nitro Archive) ...                             |

```

The NARC is a nintendo-specific virtual filesystem. For details, see:
- [DS Cartridge NitroROM and NitroARC FileSystems](./dscartridgenitroromandnitroarcfilesystems.md)
The NARC archive contains the following files:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      .twl-nup-cert.der    - server cert for software update server    |
|      .twl                                                             |
| -nup-prvkey.der  - client-side private key for software update server |
|      .twl-shop-cert.der   - server cert for Shopping Channel server   |
|      .twl-                                                            |

|                                                                       |
|   eula_url.bin         - URL to the EULA text for this system update, |
|                                                                       |
|                    generally https://cfh.t.app.nintendowifi.net/eula/ |
|                                                                       |
|    nup_host.bin         - server to query for the next system update, |
|                             generally nus.t.shop.nintendowifi.net:443 |
|      time_stam                                                        |
| p.bin       - build date for this version, eg. 00281108 (28 Nov 2008) |
|      user_are                                                         |
| a_size.bin   - eg. 08000000h (signed) (=128Mbyte? aka 1024 "blocks"?) |
|                                                                       |
|   version.bin          - firmware version (and version/region string) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The NARC is usually mounted as \"verdata:\" device (eg
\"verdata:/version.bin\").
The four \".twl-\*.der\" files are encrypted with ES Block Encryptio
(using a fixed key):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
- |       KEY[00h..0Fh] = Constant (08,2F,61,38,...)  ;from ARM7BIOS      |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For the decrypted .der files (and unecrypted NintendoCA-G2.der file),
see
- [DSi SD/MMC Firmware Certificate/Keys(./dsisdmmcfirmwarecertificatekeysder.md)
The version.bin file contains the firmare version:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000h 2    Major Version (0001h)                       (eg. 1)   |
|       002h 2    Minor Version (0000h..0004h)                (eg. 4)   |
|                                                                       |
|  004h 1Ch  Version/Region string in UTF-16, zeropadded (eg. "1.4.5E") |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Version/Region string is displayed in System Settings. The region
suffix is \"J\"=JAP, \"U\"=USA, \"E\"=EUR, \"A\"=AUS, \"C\"=CHN
\"K\"=KOR, or \"ALL\"=3DS/New3DS.

JAP region launched first (unknown if there was any pre-installed
version prior to the v1.0 update (or if v1.0 was really released as
\"update\" at all), unknown if v1.1 did also exist).
USA/EUR/AUS regions launched on 03 Apr 2009 (so only v1.3 and up exist
as update?; but they had an older version pre-installed: v1.2U is known
to exist).
CHN region launched on 11 Sep 2010 with firmware v1.4.2C (or more
probably with v1.4.1C pre-installed?).
KOR region launched at unknown date (probably near chinese launch date)
(korean v1.4.1K is known to exist).
CHN and KOR do have version numbers one step higher than normal regions
(ie. v1.4 through v1.4.5 are called v1.4.1 through v1.4.6 in
china/korea).
3DS and New3DS identify themselves as DSi version v1.4.2ALL.
