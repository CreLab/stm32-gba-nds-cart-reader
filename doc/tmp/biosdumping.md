**GBA BIOS**
Contains SWI Functions and Bootcode (for starting cartridges, or booting
via Serial Port). The GBA BIOS can be read only by opcodes executed in
BIOS area, for example, via the MidiKey2Freq function (most other SWI
Functions (like CpuSet) are refusing source addresses within BIOS
area).

**NDS BIOSes**
Contains SWI Functions and Bootcode (for booting from SPI Bus Firmware
FLASH memory). The NDS9 BIOS can be dumped without restrictions (eg. via
CpuSet, or via LDR opcodes in RAM). The NDS7 BIOS has same restrictions
as GBA, ie. reading works only by BIOS opcodes, and not by functions
like CpuSet. The GetCRC16 functions does work though (at least for
memory at 1204h..3FFFh). As an additional obstacle, memory at
0000h..1203h can be dumped only by opcodes within 0000h..1203h (that
memory does mainly contain data, but some of the data values can serve
as THUMB LDR opcodes). For details see:
- [DS Memory Control - BIOS](./dsmemorycontrolbios.md)
Note: DSi consoles are containing a copy of the NDS BIOSes, but with
BIOSPROT set to 0020h (even when running in NDS mode), so the first 20h
bytes of the DSi\'s NDS7 BIOS aren\'t dumpable (except via tracing, se
below), that 20h bytes should be just same as on original NDS7 though.

**DSi BIOSes - Lower 32K-halves (SWI Functions)**
The lower 32K of DSi9 doesn\'t have any restricions. The lower 32K o
DSi7 has similar restrictions as NDS7, but with BIOSPROT set to 0020h
(instead of 1204h), this is making it more easy to dump memory at
0020h..7FFFh (eg. via GetCRC16), but makes it impossible to dump the
exception vectors at 0000h..001Fh, however, they can be deduced by
tracing (with timer IRQs):

```

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Aside from branch opcodes, above could theoretically contain ALU opcodes
that modify R15 (but that would be very unlikely, and would make no
difference) (and, the above 20h bytes are dumped/confirmed on 3DS in DSi
mode).

**DSi BIOSes - Upper 32K-halves (Bootcode, for booting from eMMC
memory)**
The upper 32K of the DSi9 and DSi7 BIOSes are locked at some point
during booting, and there\'s no known way to dump them directly
However, portions of that memory are relocated to RAM/TCM before
locking, and that relocated copies can be dumped.
On a DSi, the following DSi ROM data can be dumped (originally done via
Main Memory hacks, ie. with complex external hardware soldered to the
mainboard, but it\'s now also possible via Unlaunch.dsi exploit):

```

On a 3DS, the following \"DSi ROM data\" can be dumped from th
2470h-byte DSi key area in 3DS memory at ARM9 ITCM 01FFD000h..01FFF46F
(via 3DS exploits that are capable of executing code on ARM9 side):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       ROM:FFFF87F4h / 3DS:01FFD000h  200h  RSA keys 0..3 (4x80h)      |
|       ROM:00008308h / 3DS:01FFD200h  80h   some AES keys              |
|       ROM:FFFF9920h / 3DS:01FFD280h  80h   whatever                   |
|                                                                       |
| ROM:0000B5D8h / 3DS:01FFD300h  40h   AES keys and values (common etc) |
|                                                                       |
|      ROM:?         / 3DS:01FFD340h  A0h   misc "Nintendo" string etc. |
|       ROM:0000C6D0h / 3DS:01FFD3E0h  1048h Blowfish for DSi-mode      |
|       ROM:FFFF99A0h / 3DS:01FFE428h  1048h Blowfish for DS-mode       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The 3DS does have only half of the DSi keys (the extra keys might be
used for DSi debug version, but aren\'t needed for normal DS
software).
The 40h-byte area for ROM:0000B5D8h can be fully dumped from 3DS ITCM,
the same vales should also exist in DSi ITCM, but the DSi zerofills a
10h-byte fraction of that area after initialization, and it doesn\'
seem be possible to read that values via Main Memory hacks (most of that
erased values can be found in AES keyslots though).
The A0h-byte area is found only in 3DS ITCM, it should also exist
somewhere in DSi ROM, but isn\'t relocated to DSi ITCM (however, th
relevant values can be found in AES keyslots, eg. the \"Nintendo\
string).

**3DS BIOS**
Can be dumped by crashing the 3DS with wrong voltages, or by using
sighax to crash the bootrom before disabling the upper 32Kbyte halves of
the ARM9/ARM11 ROMs.

**DSiWifi BIOS**
The Wifi BIOS can be dumped by using the WINDOW_DATA register via SDIO
CMD53.

**Further DSi BIOSes**
The DSi cameras and several other I2C/SPI devices are probably having
BIOS ROMs, too. Unknown if/how that ROMs are dumpable.

**DSi BIOS Dumping via voltage errors**
Lowering VDD12 for a moment does work quite reliable for crashing the
ARM9 and trapping the 2FFFD9Ch vector in Main RAM. The problem is that
Main RAM seems to be disabled during bootstage 1 (it gets enabled at
begin of bootstage 2 via EXMEMCNT, that is, shortly after the upper BIOS
32Kbyte areas are disabled). More on that here:

```

|       http://4dsdev.kuribo64.net/thread.php?id=130                    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

One theory/idea (from dark_samus) is that EXMEMCNT controls the CE2 pin
on the Main RAM chip, so one could try to rewire that pin to get Main
RAM enabled regardless of EXMEMCNT, if that\'s actually working, the
trapping the 2FFFD9Ch vector should work even while BIOS ROMs are fully
readable.
