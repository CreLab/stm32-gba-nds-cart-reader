# 3DS I2C MCU\[60h-7Fh\] - Misc Status


- **MCU\[60h\] - Battery-backed RAM Index (R/W)**
- **MCU\[61h\] - Battery-backed RAM Data (200 bytes) ;ARRAY\[C8h\
(R/W)**
This is a battery-backed 200-byte general purpose RAM area. The MCU
itself doesn\'t care about the RAM content. Instead, the ARM CPU can us
it to store powerdown/error flags (and then check those flags on next
boot).

```

When exceeding the C8h-byte array size: Writing to index=C8h..FFh is
ignored (and the index is not incremented). Reading from index=C8h..FFh
returns data=00h (and the index is incremented, and can wrap from
index=FFh to index=00h).

**Wifi button**
The Wifi button does trigger an MCU interrupt, but doesn\'
automatically enable/disable the Wifi LED, Wifi Disable bit, or other
Wifi Hardware. Instead, the ARM software should process the Wifi button
IRQ as so:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
- |   - Toggle the Wifi Disabled flag in battery backed MCU[61h:00h].bit0 |
- |      - Enable/disable the Wifi LED in MCU[2Ah] accordingly            |
|      - Enable/disable the overall Wifi hardware accordingly           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Wifi button exists only in Old3DS (but New3DS does reportedly have a
similar option\... in System Settings or so?).
