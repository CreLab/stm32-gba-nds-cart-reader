# 3DS I2C MCU\[60h-7Fh\] - Misc Status


### MCU\[60h\] - Battery-backed RAM Index (R/W)
### MCU\[61h\] - Battery-backed RAM Data (200 bytes) ;ARRAY\[C8h\] (R/W)
This is a battery-backed 200-byte general purpose RAM area. The MCU itself doesn\'t care about the RAM content. Instead, the ARM CPU can use it to store powerdown/error flags (and then check those flags on next boot).

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      The 1st byte at array[00h] is used to store flags for managing FIRM/NS state: |
|       bit0 = "WirelessDisabled" (0=Enable, 1=Disable) (see Wifi button)            |
|       bit1 = "SoftwareClosed"                                                      |
|       bit2 = "PowerOffInitiated"                                                   |
|       bit4 = "LegacyJumpProhibited"                                                |
|      The following 199 bytes are:                                                  |
|       Unknown, usually zerofilled (maybe contain error info/warmboot params?)      |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

When exceeding the C8h-byte array size: Writing to index=C8h..FFh is ignored (and the index is not incremented). Reading from index=C8h..FFh returns data=00h (and the index is incremented, and can wrap from index=FFh to index=00h).

### MCU\[7Fh\] - Various system state information ;ARRAY\[09h/13h\] (R)

### Wifi button
The Wifi button does trigger an MCU interrupt, but doesn\'t automatically enable/disable the Wifi LED, Wifi Disable bit, or other Wifi Hardware. Instead, the ARM software should process the Wifi button IRQ as so:

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|      - Toggle the Wifi Disabled flag in battery backed MCU[61h:00h].bit0 |
|      - Enable/disable the Wifi LED in MCU[2Ah] accordingly               |
|      - Enable/disable the overall Wifi hardware accordingly              |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The Wifi button exists only in Old3DS (but New3DS does reportedly have a similar option\... in System Settings or so?).
