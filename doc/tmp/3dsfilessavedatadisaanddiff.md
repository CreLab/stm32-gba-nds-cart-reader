# 3DS Files - Savedata DISA and DIFF


DISA and DIFF are two container formats (usually containing
SAVE/BDRI/VSXE filesystems, or raw data in some cases).
The DISA/DIFF containers are storing everything in data pairs that
consist of active/inactive halves (somewhat maintaining a backup copy in
the active half, whilst allowing to write new data to the inactive
half). Additionally, there are SHA256\'s for all data blocks (for erro
checking, and for preventing hacks/patches when not having the AES-CMAC
key for the master checksum).

**Duplicated Data Pairs**
One can safely overwrite the inactive halves (whilst other tasks could
still read the old intact data, and without risking to destroy the
active data if the console crashes during writing), and finally apply
the changes by toggling the active half flags.
The disadvantages are that the duplicated data requires twice as much
memory, crawling through the 7 levels does hurt read/write access time,
writing the 7 levels does reduce the chip lifetime, the DIFI\'s and DPF
level 1-2 are using the same 200h-byte sector for active/inactive halves
(so write errors on that sectors would also destroy the old active
data).
The whole concept is either blatant nonsense, or incredibly clever (in
case Nintendo should have somehow estimated that the few benefits are
outweighting the many disadvanges).

**Variants with Duplicated or Non-duplicated Data**
1) Single Partition with Internal Level 7 (duplicated data)
2) Single Partition with External Level 7 (non-duplicated data)
3) Dual Partition (one Internal and one External for
partially-duplicated data)
4) DIFF:VSXE directory file, with data stored in separate DIFF:data
files


```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|             XXX extdata\..\Quota.dat         has external IVFC        
|             XXX extdata\..\00000000\00000002 has external IVFC        
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Format**
A DISA / DIFF file consists of the following components:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0000h 200h  Header (DISA or DIFF)                               |
|       0200h 130h  1st DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for Partition A           |
|                                                                       |
|        (and somewhere DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for Partition B, if any?) |
|                                                                       |
|      0330h 130h  2nd DIFI+IVFC+DPFS+SHA256 for Partition A (as above) |
|       1000h ...   Partition A                                         |
|       xxxxh                                                           |
|  ...   Partition B (optional, can only exist for DISA, not for DIFF). |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Encryption**
DISA and DIFF formats don\'t have their own encryption specification
They follow the encryption method defined by their media:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|  - Gamecard savegames have special wear leveling + encryption layers. |
|       - Files on SD follow the general SD filesystem encryption rule. |
|       -                                                               |
|  Files on NAND are in cleartext, after decrypting the NAND partition. |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**DISA header (used for Savegame and System savedata)**
**DIFF header (for Extdata and Title Database)**
All offsets in the header are relative to the beginning of the DISA/DIFF
file, except for partition descriptor offsets, which are relative to the
beginning of the (active) partition table.

```

```

When the partition count is 1, there is no partition B and all of its
related fields are zero.

**DIFI table**
All offsets are relative to the beginning of the DIFI partition
descriptor, except for External IVFC level 7 offset, which is relative
to the beginning of the partition.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: There are two DIFI tables (the active one being selected in
- DISA\[168h\]/DIFF\[130h\]). Both DIFI\'s are usually containing th
- exact same offsets and sizes (and do differ only by Flag in DIFI\[039h\
- and the SHA\'s at DIFI\[10Ch\]) (however, the inactive DIFI ma
initially contain unformatted garbage).

**DPFS descriptor**
This header defines each level of DPFS tree. All offsets are relative to
the beginning of the partition.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The flags are stored in 32bit snippets, weirdly with bit31 being the 1st
block (that can be resolved as \"BitNumber=BlockNumber XOR 1Fh\"). Th
flags are selecting the active half of the next level (0=1st Half, or
1=2nd Half).
The above DPFS \"size\" values refer to \"one half\" (the 1st half is a
\"offset\", the 2nd half is at \"offset+size\").

\"offset\", the 2nd half is at \"offset+level3size\").
