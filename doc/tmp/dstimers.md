# DS Timers


Same as GBA, except F = 33.513982 MHz (for both NDS9 and NDS7).
- [GBA Timers](./gbatimers.md)
Both NDS9 and NDS7 have four Timers each, eight Timers in total.
The NDS sound controller is having its own frequency generators (unlike
GBA, which needed to use Timers to drive channel A/B sounds).
