|   Write to Memory             Cmd, addr msb,lsb, write 1..MAX byte(s) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       As above, but with 24bit addr msb,mid,lsb ?                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note: MAX = Page Size (see above chip list) (no limit for FRAM).

For FLASH backup, commands should be same as for Firmware FLASH memory:
- [DS Firmware Serial Flash Memory](./dsfirmwareserialflashmemory.md)
A few NDS/DSi carts are sharing the SPI bus for FLASH and Infrared, this
requires a 00h-prefix byte for FLASH access, with slower 1MHz SPI clock
and delays, see:
- [DS Cart Infrared/Pedometers](./dscartinfraredpedometers.md)

**Status Register**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0                                                               |
| WIP  Write in Progress (1=Busy) (Read only) (always 0 for FRAM chips) |
|       1                                                               |
|   WEL  Write Enable Latch (1=Enable) (Read only, except by WREN,WRDI) |
|       2-3 WP                                                          |
|   Write Protect (0=None, 1=Upper quarter, 2=Upper Half, 3=All memory) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For 0.5K EEPROM:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       4-7 ONEs Not used (all four bits are always set to "1" each)    |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

For 8K..64K EEPROM and for FRAM:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       4-6 ZERO Not used (all three bits are always set to "0" each)   |
|       7   S                                                           |
| RWD Status Register Write Disable (0=Normal, 1=Lock) (Only if /W=LOW) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

WEL gets reset on Power-up, WRDI, WRSR, WRITE/LO/HI, and on /W=LOW.
The WRSR command allows to change ONLY the two WP bits, and the SRWD bit
(if any), these bits are non-volatile (remain intact during power-down),
respectively, the WIP bit must be checked to sense WRSR completion.

**Detection (by examining hardware responses)**
The overall memory type and bus-width can be detected by RDSR/RDID
commands:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       RDSR  RDID          Type         (bus-width)                    |
|       FFh,  FFh,FFh,FFh   None         (none)                         |
|       F0h,  FFh,FFh,FFh   EEPROM       (with 8+1bit address bus)      |
|       00h,  FFh,FFh,FFh   EEPROM/FRAM  (with 16bit address bus)       |
|       ?     ?,?,?         EEPROM       (with 24bit address bus)       |
|                                                                       |
|     00h,  xxh,xxh,xxh   FLASH        (usually with 24bit address bus) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

And, the RD commands can be used to detect the memory size/mirrors
(though that won\'t work if the memory is empty).

**Detection (in emulators)**
Nintendo is using different functions for sending cmd+addr and data. The
bus-width can be detected by counting the bytes transferred with same
program counter after chip selection. One could also try to examine
code/data in the ROM-image (but that may envolve self-decompressing code
and other obstacles).
Special cases:
Over the Hedge does initially try to access 8Kbyte EEPROM, but does
actually use 0.5Kbyte EEPROM (as workaround: re-detect the bus-width on
each transfer).
Rune Factory - A Fantasy Harvest Moon seems to be also difficult to
detect (as workaround: force 64Kbyte EEPROM on gamecode ARFx).
FLASH has same 24bit bus-width as 128Kbyte EEPROM, but isn\'t compatibl
on writing. EEPROM does use 02h=Write+Erase. FLASH does use
0Ah=Write+Erase (or D8h/DBh=Erase and 02h=Write separatly).

**Pin-Outs for EEPROM and FRAM chips**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Pin Name Expl.                                                  |
|       1  /S    Chip Select                                            |
|       2  Q     Data Out                                               |
|       3  /W    Write-Protect (not used in NDS, wired to VCC)          |
|       4  VSS   Ground                                                 |
|       5  D     Data In                                                |
|       6  C     Clock                                                  |
|       7  /HOLD Transfer-pause (not used in NDS, wired to VCC)         |
|       8  VCC   Supply 2.5 to 5.5V for M95xx0-W                        |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


FRAM (Ferroelectric Nonvolatile RAM) is fully backwards compatible with
normal EEPROMs, but comes up with faster write/erase time (no delays),
and with lower power consumption, and unlimited number of write/erase
cycles. Unlike as for normal RAM, as far as I understand, the data
remains intact without needing any battery.

**Other special save memory**

```

| DS Vision (NDS cart with microSD slot... and maybe ALSO with EEPROM?) |
|       NAN                                                             |
| D carts can store data in a read/write-able portion of the "ROM" chip |
|       Typ                                                             |
| ing Adventure does have SPI FLASH (but not directly wired to SPI bus) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**DSi Internal eMMC and External SD Card**
DSi cartridges are usually (maybe always) having SD/MMC access disabled,
so they must stick using EEPROM/FLASH chips inside of the cartridges
(which is required for NDS compatibility anyways).
However, DSiware games (downloaded from DSi Shop) are allowed to save
data on eMMC, using \"private.sav\" or \"public.sav\" files in thei
data folder. The size of that files is preset in cartridge header.
