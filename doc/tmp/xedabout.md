# XED About


**About XED**
XED is a text editor, the executable is fast and small, and it includes
comfortable editing functions. It is both intended for standard .TXT
files (or any other ASCII files, such like .ASM for assembler source
code). Also, the line-wrapping support (.XED files) can be used for
authoring stories, specifications, etc. Most of the features are much
the same as for other text editors, some special functions are pointed
out below:

**Block Selection**
XED supports good old quality block mechanisms, allowing to copy/move
the selection directly to cursor position by Ctrl+K,C/V hotkeys (without
needing to use paste). For data exchange with other programs or text
files, the block can be directly written to (or loaded from) file by
Ctrl+K,R/W. And, mainstream copy/cut/paste functions are supported as
well, by Ctrl+Ins, Shift+Del, Shift+Ins.
Note: The block remains selected even when typing text, and it won\'
get deleted when touching Del-key.

**Condensed Display Mode**
Condensed mode is activated by \"F6,C\" key combination. In this mode
only lines beginning with colon \":\", or (for assembler source cod
files) with semicolon-colon \";:\", for example:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|       :Chapter IV                                                     |
|       ;:---Sound Engine---                                            |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Normal block functions can be used in this mode to Move, Copy, or Delete
whole \'chapter(s)\'. Cursor keys can be used to move the cursor to 
specific chapter. Pushing Enter or Escape terminates condensed mode.

**Column Block Mode**
Column mode is activated by \"Ctrl+K,N\" key combination. In this mode
the block selection appears as a rectangular area, allowing to deal with
tables & columns in text files by using copy/delete, indent/unindent
block functions.
Typing \"Ctrl+K,N\" again will return to normal block mode (in which an
lines between begin/end of the block will be selected at full length).

**Blank Space**
Unlike most other editors, XED allows to move the cursor to any screen
location, including at horizontal positions after the end of the current
line. Entering space characters at such locations advances the cursor
position, but does not actually store space characters in the file.
When typing text, spaces are automatically inserted between line-end and
cursor position. Respectively, ending spaces are automatically deleted
(eg. assume that the line contains \"Hello !\", deleting \"!\" will als
remove the space character, internally).
That is of course all happening behind your back, you won\'t have t
care about it - but you can be sure that there\'ll be no hidden space
filling up disk space.

**Tabulation Marks / TAB-Key**
The TAB Key advances the cursor to the next higher tabulation location
(usually in steps of eight columns, counted from leftmost screen
border), and the appropriate number of spaces is inserted into the file
if necessary.
In overwrite mode (de-/activated by INS Key), the TAB Key simply
advances the cursor without actually inserting spaces (and without
overwriting existing text by spaces).

**Tabulation Marks / CHR(9)**
When enabled in setup (default), TAB marks are automatically expanded
into appropriate number of spaces (ie. towards next \"8-column\
position) when loading a file.
The file is normally saved by using raw SPC characters, without any
TABs. Optionally, it can be saved by using \"best-fill\" SPCs and TAB
(disabled by default), that feature may conflict with third party tools
(assemblers, compilers, etc). In order to reduce the risk of such
problems, best-fill is suppressed in quoted lines (by using \' or \" o
\<\> quotation marks, eg. db \'Hello !\').

**Line Wrapping**
Line wrapping is enabled/disabled by \"F5+W\" key combination. Wrappin
is automatically enabled when loading a file with extension \".XED\".
In the file, wrapped lines are using CR characters as soft linebreaks,
paragraphs are terminated by normal CR,LF characters.
Note: It\'d be recommended to convert .XED files into \'standard\
formats such like .TXT or .HTM before releasing them, but preferably NOT
into disliked bloated file formats such like .PDF or .DOC.

**Word Processing**
Aside from the above line-wrapping support, no other \'word processing\
features are included, the program provides normal \'type writer\
functions, not more, not less. In particular, any overload such like
bold or colored text, big and small fonts, bitmaps and different fonts
are disliked.
