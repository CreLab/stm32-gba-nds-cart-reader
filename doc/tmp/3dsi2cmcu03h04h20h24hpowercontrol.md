# 3DS I2C MCU\[03h-04h, 20h-24h\] - Power Control


- **MCU\[03h\] - LCD Top Screen VCOM \"flicker\" (R/W)**
- **MCU\[04h\] - LCD Bottom Screen VCOM \"flicker\" (R/W)**
The VCOM voltages should be half of the corresponding AVDD voltages (so
that positive and negative voltages will have same intensity), otherwise
the picture may appear flimmering, have colors with wrong brightness,
and could suffer permanent burn-in, or temporarily stuck pixels.

```

|       0-7   VCOM Voltage (00h..FFh = 0.94V .. 3.15V)                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

- The MCU firmware defaults to MCU\[03h\]=5Ch=1.74V an
- MCU\[04h\]=5Fh=1.77V, but better calibrations can be found in HWCAL an
\"config\" files.
To avoid burn-in, the 3DS is toggling between drawing pixels with
positive/negative voltages each 2nd scanline (and vice-versa in each 2nd
frame). This interlacing can cause visible dirt effects on animated,
scrolled, or blinking pixels: For example, if a \"red\" pixel exist
only in each 2nd frame, then it might end up to be always drawn with
positive voltages (with possible burn-in even if VCOM is okay, and with
wrong brightness if VCOM isn\'t properly centered, whereas, the exac
centering may change when the console does warm up).

Unknown how to fully power-off. Writing 01h does somewhat power-off, but
the battery still runs empty after 10-20 hours. Some people execute a
Wait-for-Interrupt opcode after the I2C write; not tested if that does
help (and if that opcode is needed on all ARM11 CPU core(s) and ARM9
side).

Setting bit0 does disable most or all LCD related power supplies: VCOM,
AVDD, 10V (probably also +5V and -5V), and backlights. Setting bit1
enables those supplies (except backlights, which require bit3/bit5). The
1.8V supply for the LCD I2C controllers is always on. The backlight PWM
level is controlled via ARM LCD registers.
