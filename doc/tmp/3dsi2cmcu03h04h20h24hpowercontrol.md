# 3DS I2C MCU\[03h-04h, 20h-24h\] - Power Control


### MCU\[03h\] - LCD Top Screen VCOM \"flicker\" (R/W)
### MCU\[04h\] - LCD Bottom Screen VCOM \"flicker\" (R/W)
The VCOM voltages should be half of the corresponding AVDD voltages (so that positive and negative voltages will have same intensity), otherwise the picture may appear flimmering, have colors with wrong brightness, and could suffer permanent burn-in, or temporarily stuck pixels.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   VCOM Voltage (00h..FFh = 0.94V .. 3.15V)                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The MCU firmware defaults to MCU\[03h\]=5Ch=1.74V and MCU\[04h\]=5Fh=1.77V, but better calibrations can be found in HWCAL and \"config\" files.
To avoid burn-in, the 3DS is toggling between drawing pixels with positive/negative voltages each 2nd scanline (and vice-versa in each 2nd frame). This interlacing can cause visible dirt effects on animated, scrolled, or blinking pixels: For example, if a \"red\" pixel exists only in each 2nd frame, then it might end up to be always drawn with positive voltages (with possible burn-in even if VCOM is okay, and with wrong brightness if VCOM isn\'t properly centered, whereas, the exact centering may change when the console does warm up).

Unknown how to fully power-off. Writing 01h does somewhat power-off, but the battery still runs empty after 10-20 hours. Some people execute a Wait-for-Interrupt opcode after the I2C write; not tested if that does help (and if that opcode is needed on all ARM11 CPU core(s) and ARM9 side).

Setting bit0 does disable most or all LCD related power supplies: VCOM, AVDD, 10V (probably also +5V and -5V), and backlights. Setting bit1 enables those supplies (except backlights, which require bit3/bit5). The 1.8V supply for the LCD I2C controllers is always on. The backlight PWM level is controlled via ARM LCD registers.

### MCU\[24h\] - Forced Power Off delay (0=Never,1=Fastest,5Dh=InsaneDefault) (R/W)

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7   Delay in 8Hz units, this value seems to be battery backed |
|             (the value seems to also affect the bootrom error screen) |
