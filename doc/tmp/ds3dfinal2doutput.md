# DS 3D Final 2D Output


The final 3D image (consisting of polygons and rear-plane) is passed to
2D Engine A as BG0 layer (provided that DISPCNT is configured to use 3D
as BG0).

**Scrolling**
The BG0HOFS register (4000010h) can be used the scroll the 3D layer
horizontally, the scroll region is 512 pixels, consisting of 256 pixels
for the 3D image, followed by 256 transparent pixels, and then wrapped
to the 3D image again. Vertical scrolling (and rotation/scaling) cannot
be used on the 3D layer.

**BG Priority Order**
The lower 2bit of the BG0CNT register (4000008h) control the priority
relative to other BGs and OBJs, so the 3D layer can be in front of or
behind 2D layers. All other bits in BG0CNT have no effect on 3D, namely,
mosaic cannot be used on the 3D layer.

**Special Effects**
Special Effects Registers (4000050h..54h) can be used as such:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Brightness up/down with BG0 as 1st Target via EVY   (as for 2D) |
|       Blending with BG0 as 2nd Target via EVA/EVB         (as for 2D) |
|       B                                                               |
| lending with BG0 as 1st Target via 3D Alpha-values (unlike as for 2D) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The latter method probably (?) uses per-pixel 3D alpha values as such:
EVA=A/2, and EVB=16-A/2, without using the EVA/EVB settings in
4000052h.

**Window Feature**
Window Feature (4000040h..4Bh) can be used as for 2D.
\"If the 3D screen has highest priority, then alpha-blending is alway
enabled, regardless of the Window Control register\'s color effec
- enable flag \[ie. regardless of Bit5 of WIN0IN, WIN1IN, WINOBJ, WINOU
registers\]\"\... not sure if that is true, and if it superseedes th
effect selection in Port 4000050h\...?
