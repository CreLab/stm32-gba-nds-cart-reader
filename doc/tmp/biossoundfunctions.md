**SWI 1Fh (GBA) - MidiKey2Freq**
- Calculates the value of the assignment to ((SoundArea)sa).vchn\[x\].f
when playing the wave data, wa, with the interval (MIDI KEY) mk and the
fine adjustment value (halftones=256) fp.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0  WaveData* wa                                                |

|       r2  u8 fp                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0  u32                                                         |

```

This function is particularly popular because it allows to read from
BIOS memory without copy protection range checks. The formula to read
one byte (a) from address (i, 0..3FFF) is:
a = (MidiKey2Freq(i-(((i AND 3)+1)OR 3), 168, 0) \* 2) SHR 24

**SWI 19h (GBA) or SWI 08h (NDS7/DSi7) - SoundBias**
Increments or decrements the current level of the SOUNDBIAS register
(with short delays) until reaching the desired new level. The upper bits
of the register are kept unchanged.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0   BIAS level (0=Level 000h, any other value=Level 200h)      |
|                                                                       |
|   r1   Delay Count (NDS/DSi only) (GBA uses a fixed delay count of 8) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No return value.

**SWI 1Eh (GBA) - SoundChannelClear**
Clears all direct sound channels and stops the sound.
This function may not operate properly when the library which expands
the sound driver feature is combined afterwards. In this case, do not
use it.
No parameters, no return value.

**SWI 1Ah (GBA) - SoundDriverInit**
Initializes the sound driver. Call this only once when the game starts
up.
It is essential that the work area already be secured at the time this
function is called.
You cannot execute this driver multiple times, even if separate work
areas have been prepared.

**SWI 1Ch (GBA) - SoundDriverMain**
Main of the sound driver.
Call every 1/60 of a second. The flow of the process is to call
SoundDriverVSync, which is explained later, immediately after the
V-Blank interrupt.
After that, this routine is called after BG and OBJ processing is
executed.
No parameters, no return value.

**SWI 1Bh (GBA) - SoundDriverMode**
Sets the sound driver operation mode.

Return: No return value.

**SWI 1Dh (GBA) - SoundDriverVSync**
An extremely short system call that resets the sound DMA. The timing is
extremely critical, so call this function immediately after the V-Blank
interrupt every 1/60 second.
No parameters, no return value.

**SWI 28h (GBA) - SoundDriverVSyncOff**
Due to problems with the main program if the V-Blank interrupts are
stopped, and SoundDriverVSync cannot be called every 1/60 a second, this
function must be used to stop sound DMA.
Otherwise, even if you exceed the limit of the buffer the DMA will not
stop and noise will result.
No parameters, no return value.

**SWI 29h (GBA) - SoundDriverVSyncOn**
This function restarts the sound DMA stopped with the previously
described SoundDriverVSyncOff.
After calling this function, have a V-Blank occur within 2/60 of a
second and call SoundDriverVSync.
No parameters, no return value.

**SWI 20h..24h (GBA) - SoundWhatever0..4 (Undocumented)**
Whatever undocumented sound-related BIOS functions.

**SWI 2Ah (GBA) - SoundGetJumpList (Undocumented)**
Receives pointers to 36 additional sound-related BIOS functions.
