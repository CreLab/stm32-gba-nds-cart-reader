### SWI 1Fh (GBA) - MidiKey2Freq
Calculates the value of the assignment to ((SoundArea)sa).vchn\[x\].fr when playing the wave data, wa, with the interval (MIDI KEY) mk and the fine adjustment value (halftones=256) fp.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0  WaveData* wa                                                |
|       r1  u8 mk                                                       |
|       r2  u8 fp                                                       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0  u32                                                         |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

This function is particularly popular because it allows to read from BIOS memory without copy protection range checks. The formula to read one byte (a) from address (i, 0..3FFF) is:
a = (MidiKey2Freq(i-(((i AND 3)+1)OR 3), 168, 0) \* 2) SHR 24

### SWI 19h (GBA) or SWI 08h (NDS7/DSi7) - SoundBias
Increments or decrements the current level of the SOUNDBIAS register (with short delays) until reaching the desired new level. The upper bits of the register are kept unchanged.

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0   BIAS level (0=Level 000h, any other value=Level 200h)          |
|       r1   Delay Count (NDS/DSi only) (GBA uses a fixed delay count of 8) |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No return value.

### SWI 1Eh (GBA) - SoundChannelClear
Clears all direct sound channels and stops the sound.
This function may not operate properly when the library which expands the sound driver feature is combined afterwards. In this case, do not use it.
No parameters, no return value.

### SWI 1Ah (GBA) - SoundDriverInit
Initializes the sound driver. Call this only once when the game starts up.
It is essential that the work area already be secured at the time this function is called.
You cannot execute this driver multiple times, even if separate work areas have been prepared.

Return: No return value.

### SWI 1Ch (GBA) - SoundDriverMain
Main of the sound driver.
Call every 1/60 of a second. The flow of the process is to call SoundDriverVSync, which is explained later, immediately after the V-Blank interrupt.
After that, this routine is called after BG and OBJ processing is executed.
No parameters, no return value.

### SWI 1Bh (GBA) - SoundDriverMode
Sets the sound driver operation mode.

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No return value.

### SWI 1Dh (GBA) - SoundDriverVSync
An extremely short system call that resets the sound DMA. The timing is extremely critical, so call this function immediately after the V-Blank interrupt every 1/60 second.
No parameters, no return value.

### SWI 28h (GBA) - SoundDriverVSyncOff
Due to problems with the main program if the V-Blank interrupts are stopped, and SoundDriverVSync cannot be called every 1/60 a second, this function must be used to stop sound DMA.
Otherwise, even if you exceed the limit of the buffer the DMA will not stop and noise will result.
No parameters, no return value.

### SWI 29h (GBA) - SoundDriverVSyncOn
This function restarts the sound DMA stopped with the previously described SoundDriverVSyncOff.
After calling this function, have a V-Blank occur within 2/60 of a second and call SoundDriverVSync.
No parameters, no return value.

### SWI 20h..24h (GBA) - SoundWhatever0..4 (Undocumented)
Whatever undocumented sound-related BIOS functions.

### SWI 2Ah (GBA) - SoundGetJumpList (Undocumented)
Receives pointers to 36 additional sound-related BIOS functions.

```
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       r0  Destination address (must be aligned by 4) (120h bytes buffer) |
