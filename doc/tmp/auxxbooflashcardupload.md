# AUX Xboo Flashcard Upload


**Flashcard Upload**
Allows to write data to flashcards which are plugged into GBA cartridge
slot, cartridge is automatically started after writing. On initial
power-up, hold down START+SELECT to prevent the GBA from booting the old
program in the flashcard.
The Upload function in Utility menu uses flashcard mode for files bigger
than 256KB (otherwise uses multiboot mode automatically). Also, there\'
a separate Upload to Flashcard function in Remote Access submenu,
allowing to write files of 256KB or less to flashcard if that should be
desired.

**Supported Flashcards**
Function currently tested with Visoly Flash Advance (FA) 256Mbit (32MB)
Turbo cartridge. Should also work with older FA versions. Please let me
know if you are using other flashcards which aren\'t yet supported.

**Flashcard Performance**
Writing to flashcards may become potentially slow because of chip
erase/write times, cable transmission time, and the sheer size of larger
ROM-images. However, developers whom are testing different builts of
their project usually won\'t need to rewrite the complete flashcard
Xboo uses a highspeed checksum mechanism (16MB/sec) to determine which
flashcard sector(s) have changed, and does then re-write only these
sector(s).
To eliminate transmission time, data transfer takes place in the erase
phases. Erase/write time depends on the flashcard type, should be circa
1-2 seconds per 256KB sector. Because the cartridge is programmed
directly in the GBA there\'s no need to remove it from the GBA whe
writing to it.

**Developers Advice**
Locate your program fragments at fixed addresses, for example, code and
data blocks each aligned to 64K memory boundaries, so that data remains
at the same location even when the size of code changes. Fill any blank
spaces by value FFh for faster write time. Reduce the size of your
ROM-image by efficient memory use (except for above alignment trick).
Include the burst boot backdoor in your program, allowing to re-write
the flashcard directly without resetting the GBA.

**Lamers Advice**
Xboo Flashcard support does not mean to get lame & to drop normal
multiboot support, if your program fits into 256KB then make it \<both\
flashcard \<and\> multiboot compatible - multiboot reduces upload time
increases your flashcard lifetime, and will also work for people whom
don\'t own flashcards.
