**4000540h - Cmd 50h - SWAP_BUFFERS - Swap Rendering Engine Buffer
(W)**
SwapBuffers exchanges the two sets of Polygon/Vertex RAM buffers, that
is, the newly defined polygons/vertices are passed to the rendering
engine (and will be displayed in following frame(s)). The other buffer
is emptied, and passed to the Geometry Engine (to be filled with new
polygons/vertices by Geometry Commands).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|      0     Translucent polygon Y-sorting (0=Auto-sort, 1=Manual-sort) |

|                                                                       |
|       (mode 1 does not function properly with orthogonal projections) |
|       2-31  Not used                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

SwapBuffers isn\'t executed until next VBlank (Scanline 192) (th
Geometry Engine is halted for that duration). SwapBuffers should not be
issued within Begin/End. The two parameter bits of the SwapBuffers
command are used for the following gxcommands (ie. not for the old
gxcommands prior to SwapBuffers).
SwapBuffers does lock-up the 3D hardware if an incomplete polygon list
has been defined (eg. a triangle with only 2 vertices). On lock-up, only
2D video is kept working, any wait-loops for GXSTAT.27 will hang the
program. Once lock-up has occured, there seems to be no way to recover
by software, not by sending the missing veric(es), and not even by
pulsing POWCNT1.Bit2-3.

**4000580h - Cmd 60h - VIEWPORT - Set Viewport (W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
| 0-7   Screen/BG0 Coordinate X1 (0..255) (For Fullscreen: 0=Left-most) |

| 15  Screen/BG0 Coordinate Y1 (0..191) (For Fullscreen: 0=Bottom-most) |
|       16-                                                             |
| 23 Screen/BG0 Coordinate X2 (0..255) (For Fullscreen: 255=Right-most) |
|       2                                                               |
| 4-31 Screen/BG0 Coordinate Y2 (0..191) (For Fullscreen: 191=Top-most) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Coordinate 0,0 is the lower-left (unlike for 2D where it\'d b
upper-left).
The 3D view-volume (size as defined by the Projection Matrix) is
automatically scaled to match into the Viewport area. Although polygon
vertices are clipped to the view-volume, some vertices may still exceed
to X2,Y1 (lower-right) boundary by one pixel, due to some sort of
rounding errors. The Viewport settings don\'t affect the size o
position of the 3D Rear-Plane. Viewport should not be issued within
Begin/End.

**4000610h - DISP_1DOT_DEPTH - 1-Dot Polygon Display Boundary Depth
(W)**
1-Dot Polygons are very small, or very distant polygons, which would be
rendered as a single pixel on screen. Polygons with a depth value
greater (more distant) than DISP_1DOT_DEPTH can be automatically hidden;
in order to reduce memory consumption, or to reduce dirt on the screen.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|    0-14  W-Coordinate (Unsigned, 12bit integer, 3bit fractional part) |
|                                                                       |
|    15-31 Not used                 (0000h=Closest, 7FFFh=Most Distant) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The DISP_1DOT_DEPTH comparision can be enabled/disabled per polygon (via
POLYGON_ATTR.Bit13), so \"important\" polygons can be displaye
regardless of their size and distance.
Note: The comparision is always using the W-coordinate of the vertex
(not the Z-coordinate) (ie. no matter if using Z-buffering, or
W-buffering). The polygon is rendered if at least one of its vertices is
having a w-coordinate less or equal than DISP_1DOT_DEPTH. NB. despite of
checking the w-coords of ALL vertices, the polygon is rendered using the
color/depth/texture of its FIRST vertex.
Note: The hardware does round-up the width and height of all polygons to
at least 1, so polygons of 0x0, 1x0, 0x1, and 1x1 dots will be all
rounded-up to a size of 1x1. Of which, the so-called \"1dot\" dept
check is applied only to the 0x0 dot variant (so \"0dot\" depth chec
would be a better name for it).
Caution: Although DISP_1DOT_DEPTH is a Geometry Engine parameter, it is
NOT routed through GXFIFO, ie. changes will take place immediately, and
will affect all following polygons, including such that are still in
GXFIFO. Workaround: ensure that GXFIFO is empty before changing this
parameter.

**4000340h - ALPHA_TEST_REF - Alpha-Test Comparision Value (W)**
Alpha Test can be enabled in DISP3DCNT.Bit2. When enabled, pixels are
rendered only if their Alpha value is GREATER than ALPHA_TEST_REF.
Otherwise, when disabled, pixels are rendered only if their Alpha value
is GREATER than zero. Alpha Test is performed on the final polygon
pixels (ie. after texture blending).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-4                                                             |
|  Alpha-Test Comparision Value (0..31) (Draw pixels if Alpha>AlphaRef) |
|       5-31  Not used                                                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Value 00h is effectively the same as when Alpha Test is disabled. Value
1Fh hides all polygons, including opaque ones.
