**SWI 0Fh (GBA) - ObjAffineSet**
Calculates and sets the OBJ\'s affine parameters from the scaling rati
and angle of rotation.
The affine parameters are calculated from the parameters set in Srcp.
The four affine parameters are set every Offset bytes, starting from the
Destp address.
If the Offset value is 2, the parameters are stored contiguously. If the
value is 8, they match the structure of OAM.
When Srcp is arrayed, the calculation can be performed continuously by
specifying Num.

Return: No return value, Data written to destination address.

For both Bg- and ObjAffineSet, Rotation angles are specified as 0-FFFFh
(covering a range of 360 degrees), however, the GBA BIOS recurses only
the upper 8bit; the lower 8bit may contain a fractional portion, but it
is ignored by the BIOS.
