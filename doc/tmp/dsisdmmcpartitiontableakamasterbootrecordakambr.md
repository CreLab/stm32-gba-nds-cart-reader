# DSi SD/MMC Partition Table (aka Master Boot Record aka MBR)


**DSi eMMC Partition table**
The decrypted DSi MBR contains (for 240MB chips; 3rd part differs for
245.5MB):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|       01F                                                             |

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Above values are following the classical standard MBR format:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       000                                                             |
| h      446  bootcode (zerofilled on DSi)                   ;-bootcode |
|                                                                       |
|      1BEh+n*10h  1  status (00h)                                   ;\ 
|                                                                       |
|  1BFh+n*10h  3  chsFirst                                       ; four |
|       1C2h+                                                           |

|       1C3                                                             |
| h+n*10h  3  chsLast                                        ; (n=0..3) |
|       1C6h+n*10h  4  lbaFirst  ;\logical block addresses/sizes      ; 
|                                                                       |
|      1CAh+n*10h  4  lbaSize   ;/counted in 200h-byte sectors       ;/ |
|       1                                                               |
| FEh        2  mbrsig (55h,AAh)                               ;-MBR ID |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The CHS and LBA values are essentially containing the same information
(CHS being an older standard, and LBA being invented in 1996). The 24bit
CHS values are encoded as:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-7    Head Bit0-7     (00h..FEh) (or less common, 00h..FFh)    |
|       8-13   Sector Bit0-5   (01h..3Fh)                               |
|       14-15  Cylinder Bit8-9                                          |
|       16-23  Cylinder Bit0-7 (000h..3FFh, with above bit8-7)          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

To convert CHS to LBA, one must know the number of (logical) heads and
sectors per cylinder (that info isn\'t stored in the MBR). The DSi\'
eMMC uses 32 sectors, 16 heads, 1024 cylinders:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       LBA = (Cylinder*32*16) + (Head*32) + (Sector-1)                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Anyways, it\'s better/easier to use the LBA values directly, and ignor
the CHS values.

**3DS eMMC Partition table**
The 3DS does have a DSi compatible MBR (with main & photo partitions, as
shown above). The additional 3DS partitions are accessed via a separate
\"NCSD\" header (with 3DS specific encryption keys, which aren\'
available in DSi mode).

**SD/MMC Card Partition table**
SD/MMC Cards are shipped with pre-formatted filesystem, so they should
stick to some standarized MBR variant, with only a single partition
used, possibly with additional date/id fields(?).
Note that SD/MMC Cards may or may not use partition tables (see CSD
Register, FILE_FORMAT entry).

**Formatting and Reformatting**
SD/MMC cards are usually pre-formatted with empty filesystems.
Reformatting should be avoided, or should be done only with tools that
are aware of some memory card specific requirements:
The cluster size should not be less than the physical sector size
(otherwise, when writing smaller clusters, sectors may get erased
multiple times, which would result in slower writing and reduced
lifetime).
Many devices do support only the standard FAT filesystems (for example,
cameras or mp3-players may be unable to access memory cards with NTFS
filesystem).
