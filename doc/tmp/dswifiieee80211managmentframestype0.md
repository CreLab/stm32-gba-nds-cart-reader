# DS Wifi IEEE802.11 Managment Frames (Type=0)


All Managment Frames have 24-byte Frame Header, with following values:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       FC(2), Duration(2), DA(6), SA(6), BSSID(6), Sequence Control(2) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The content of the Frame Body depends on the FC\'s Subtype:
