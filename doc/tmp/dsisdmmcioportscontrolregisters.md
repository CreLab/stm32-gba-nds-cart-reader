```

The DSi uses HCLK=33.513982 MHz, the SDCLK pin can range from
HCLK/512=65kHz to HCLK/2=16.757MHz, max transfer rate would be thus
8MByte/s in 4bit mode.
**Max CLK speed:**
Observe that card detection/initialization should be done at lower CLK
rate than during normal operation.
For SD/MMC initialization: The DSi firmware starts with HCLK/128=262kHz
(max allowed would be 400kHz for MMC). This is actually required: The
DSi\'s onboard Samsung KMAPF0000M-S998 eMMC chip won\'t respond t
ALL_GET_CID when trying to use 16MHz CLK). Higher CLK can be used once
when detecting max speed (see TRAN_SPEED in CSD register; when
extracting bits from CSD: mind the different 120bit-without-CRC vs
128bit-with-CRC notations).
For SDIO/Wifi initialization: The DSi firmware starts with
HCLK/256=131kHz, and switches to HCLK/2=16.757MHz after reading SDIO Bus
Speed register (Function0:00013h).
After init, one can use the detected speeds (see above), it should be
also safe to assume that HCLK/2=16.757MHz is always supported after
initialization (all SD devices should support at least 25MHz, and all(?)
MMC devices at least 26MHz, and all DSi SDIO/Wifi boards should be fast
enough either).
**Notes:**
The SDCLK pins are permanently pulsed, even for devices deselected via
SD_CARD_PORT_SELECT.0, and even if no CMD or DATA is being transferred.
However, the DSi firmware is usually stopping SDCLK via Bit8=0 when not
accessing SD/MMC (doing so may reduce noise and power consumption).
Setting bit9, or to trying to set more than one bit in bit7-0 will
freeze the SDCLK output (in this case SDCLK may get stuck HIGH or LOW,
unlike Bit8=0 which forces LOW).
Odd Effect: Setting bit10-8 to ALL ones, combined with an invalid HDIV
(eg. writing 0703h) does disable CardIRQ on Data1 pin.

**4004808h/4004A08h - SD_STOP_INTERNAL_ACTION**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       15-9   Always zero                                              |
|       8                                                               |

|  Unknown (firmware often clears this bit, but never sets it?)   (R/W) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Existing code does set bit8 (prior to changing SD_DATA16_BLK_COUNT).
Existing code does clear bit0 (alongsides with IRQ enable/acknowledge or
so).
Note: Bit8 MUST be also set for SDIO with multiple blocks (although SDIO
doesn\'t literally have CMD12).

**40048E0h/4004AE0h - SD_SOFT_RESET - Software Reset**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|       2                                                               |

|       1                                                               |
|    Unknown (always 1) (though firmware tries to toggle this bit) (R?) |
|       0                                                               |
|   SRST Soft Reset (0=Reset, 1=Release)                          (R/W) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Software should apply reset after sensing card insertion/removal, and
(thereafter) release reset in case of card insertion. Software reset
does acknowledge all IRQs (except that from SDIO /IRQ pin?), and does
probably also reinitialize some other registers.
Clearing bit0 does force following settings (while and as long as
Bit0=0):

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SD_STOP_INTERNAL_ACTION   = 0000h                               |
|       SD_RESPONSE0-7            = zerofilled                          |
|       SD_IRQ_STATUS0-1          = all IRQ flags acknowledged          |
|       S                                                               |
| D_ERROR_DETAIL_STATUS0-1 = all bits cleared (except bit13/always set) |
|       SD_CARD_CLK_CTL           = bit 8 and 10 cleared                |
|       SD_CARD_OPTION            = 40EEh                               |
|       SD_CARD_IRQ_STAT          = 0000h                               |
|       Internal FIFO16 address is reset to first halfword of FIFO_A    |
|       Reading                                                         |
| FIFO16 returns 0000h (but old content reappears when releasing reset) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

All other registers seem to be left unaffected (including the extra IRQ
flags in 4004900h); though there may be some further hidden effects
(like aborting transfers or resetting internal registers).
Note: The DSi firmware does issue reset by toggling both bit0 and bit1,
although bit1 does seem to be read-only (always 1), and trying to clear
that bit doesn\'t seem to have any effect at all.

**Timeout Notes**
Timeouts are counted in SDCLK units (the CLK-Pin rate selected in
SD_CARD_CLK_CTL register). For Response-Timeouts, the timeout is fixed:
Around 290h SDCLK\'s (preceeded by 30h SDCLK\'s for sending th
command). For Data-Timeouts, the timeout can be selected in
SD_CARD_OPTION.bit4-7, which is apparently what toshiba tried to
describe as \"RTO\" bits. Values 0..14 select timeout \"2000h SHL 0..1
SDCLK\'s\" and value 15 selects \"100h SDCLK\'s\" (that, oddly
resulting in Data-timeout getting triggered before Response-timeout,
which is rather nonsense since it\'s opposite of the actual transfe
order).
For data/read, the timeout starts counting after transferring
Command+Response. For data/write it starts after transferring
Command+Response+DataBlock. The maximum duration for data timeouts (with
RTO=14) would be around 8 seconds (at SDCLK=HCLK/2), or up to about 30
minutes (at HCLK/512).
One odd effect is that Response-Timeouts can occur (after 290h SDCLKs,
and recursing the selected SDCLK=HCLK/n rate) even if SDCLK is stopped
via SD_CARD_CLK_CTL.Bit8 (ie. the selected clock is kept running
internally, and only the CLK-Pin output is forced LOW when Bit8=0).

**CFG9_SDMMC_CTL and SD_CARD_OPTION**
On DSi, SD/MMC Slot power supply is always on (it takes about 3ms to
reach the 3.3V after power on; if the console booted up and loaded data
from eMMC, one can be sure that the SD/MMC Slot is properly powered
up).
On 3DS, SD/MMC Slot power supply can be enabled/disabled, the bootrom
does leave it disabled, so, before accessing SD/MMC Slot or before
testing the card insert flag, FIRM software must enable it (set
CFG9_SDMMC_CTL bit0=0 and usually bit9=1, it takes about 4.2ms to reach
3.3V, SD cards may take 1ms to boot up, for those 4.2ms+1ms delays, best
set the SIGSTATE detect delay in SD_CARD_OPTION.bit0-3 to 09h, ie. circa
8ms).
