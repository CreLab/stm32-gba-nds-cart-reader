# GBA Cart Rumble


Warioware Twisted (Rumble, plus Z-Axis Gyro Sensor)
Drill Dozer (Rumble only) \<\-- and ALSO supports Gameboy Player rumble?

GBA Rumble Carts are containing a small motor, which is causing some vibration when/while it is switched on (that, unlike DS Rumble, which must be repeatedly toggled on/off).

In Warioware Twisted, rumble is controlled via GPIO.Bit3 (Data 0=Low=Off, 1=High=On) (and Direction 1=Output), the other GPIO Bits are used for the gyro sensor.

Note: GPIO3 is connected to an external pulldown resistor (so the HighZ level gets dragged to Low=Off when direction is set to Input).

Unknown if Drill Dozer is controlled via GPIO.Bit3, too?

### DS Rumble Pak
Additionally, there\'s a Rumble Pak for the NDS, which connects to the GBA slot, so it can be used also for GBA games (provided that the game doesn\'t require the GBA slot, eg. GBA multiboot games).

### Gamecube Rumble
Moreover, GBA games that are running on a Gameboy Player are having access to the Rumble function of Gamecube joypads.
