# DS Wifi Multiplay Master


These registers are used for multiplay host-to-client (aka master to
slave) commands.

**48080EEh - W_CMD_COUNTCNT (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0     Enable W_CMD_COUNT (0=Disable, 1=Enable)                  |
|       1-15  Always Zero                                               |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**4808118h - W_CMD_COUNT (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-15  Decremented once every 10 microseconds (Stopped at 0000h) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Defines the time interval during which W_TXBUF_CMD transfers are
possible. That CMD will be automatically transferred again if there are
errors (missing REPLY\'s), but it will abort if there isn\'t enough tim
left in W_CMD_COUNT.
IRQ12 is thrown when cmd/reply were successful, or when CMD_COUNT
reached zero (failed).
Firmware Beacon IRQ14 handler checks for W_CMD_COUNT\<=0Ah.

**48080C0h - W_CMD_TOTALTIME - (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-15  Duration per ALL slave response packet(s) in microseconds |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Before sending a MASTER packet, this port should be set to the same
value as the MASTER packet\'s IEEE header\'s Duration/ID entry.

**48080C4h - W_CMD_REPLYTIME - (R/W)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       0-15  Duration per SINGLE slave response packet in microseconds |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Before sending a MASTER packet, this port should be set to the expected
per slave response time.
Note: Nintendo\'s multiboot/pictochat code is also putting this value i
the 1st halfword of the MASTER packet\'s frame body.

**At 2MBit/s transfer rate, the values should be set up sorts of like
so:**

| 0h] = 8000h+master_packet_address   ;start transmit      ;W_TXBUF_CMD |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

With the byte values counting the ieee frame header+body+fcs.
(\*) The hardware doesn\'t actually seem to use the \"slave_bits\" entr
in the hardware header, instead, it is using the \"slave_bits\" entry i
the frame body(!)

**Sending a W_TXBUF_CMD frame starts the following process:**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|  1. MP host sends the CMD frame, as soon as possible. after preamble, |
|          IRQ7 is triggered                                            |
|                                                                       |
|     2. once the transfer is finished: if bit14 in W_TXSTATCNT is set, |
|          W_TXSTAT is set to 0x0800, and IRQ1 is triggered             |
|          somewhere here: set W_RF_STATUS=5, RFPINS=0x0084             |
|      3. hardware waits for MP clients' replies, duration is:          |
|          16                                                           |
|  + ((10 + W_CMD_REPLYTIME) * count_ones(client_mask_from_frame_body)) |
|      4. MP host sends the CMD ack. after preamble, IRQ7 is triggered  |
|          (this is why you get two IRQ7's from a CMD transfer)         |
|      5                                                                |
| . during the ack transfer, W_RF_STATUS is 8, and W_RXTXADDR is 0x0FC0 |
|                                                                       |
|     6. once the transfer is finished: if bit13 in W_TXSTATCNT is set, |
|          W_TXSTAT is set to 0x0B01, and IRQ1 is triggered.            |
|      7.                                                               |
- |  the TX header of the CMD frame is adjusted: bits in TXheader[02] are |
|          cleared to indicate that the corresponding clients responded |
|          successfully. Nintendo software checks this.                 |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

I haven\'t looked a lot into how retries work. they seem to repeat th
entire process.
the CMD ack is sent automatically. the packet is what is described here:
the 03:09:BF:00:00:03 flow. MP clients will receive it like a regular
frame.
IRQ12 is used to signal the end of the CMD transfer process. it will be
either when the final ack is done transferring, if everything was
successful, or otherwise at the end of W_CMD_COUNT.
