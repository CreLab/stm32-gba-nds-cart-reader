**Icon Bitmaps**
The 24x24pix and 48x48pix icons consist of 8x8pix tiles with 16bpp
(RGB565), the pixels (within the 8x8pix tiles) have Z-order swizzling:
- [3DS Video Texture Swizzling](./3dsvideotextureswizzling.md)
However, the tiles are arranged in linear order without swizzling (eg.
for 48x48pix: Tile 00h..05h for upper two, Tile 06h..0Bh for next row,
etc).
There is no power-of-2 padding for the width/height values (unlike
CLIM/FLIM files, which would pad 48x48pix to 64x64pix).

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       *** Unknown if (or how) Transparency is supported ***           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Most or all 3DS icons seem to have square shapes without transparent
pixels. The RGB565 format doesn\'t include alpha bits.
Unknown if there is a way to assign a transpaent color (eg. Magenta).
Nintendo is reportedly having a tool that can create SMDH files in
formats other than RGB565 (unfortunately without saying if such files
contain some kind of Texture Format entries).

**Misc**
Age Rating: Active ratings have a bitmask of 80h, and inactive ratings
have no bitmask at all. Ratings without the 80h bitmask are ignored. 40h
bitmask indicates Rating Pending. 20h bitmask indicates No Age
Restriction. Age limits are set by adding the minimal age to 80h (for
example, limiting to 12 years and up would give a bitmask of 8Ch)

Region Lockout: Regions are \'included\' in region lock by setting thei
bitmask value. Nintendo defines region free as 7FFFFFFFh. Early in the
3DS\' development, Nintendo grouped the Australian and Europe market
together. Nintendo defines market Europe as having the combined bitmasks
of Europe and Australia. No 3DS\' which check the Australia bitmask hav
been seen (Australia uses the European 3DS model).

The EULA version is checked when the Accept EULA flag is set, the
version is compared to one stored in the 3DS. If the SMDH version is
greater, then the user will be prompted to accept the EULA.

**Effect of SaveData and AutoSave**
These options have no effect on the performance of the application
itself: they\'re used to select an appropriate warning when closing a
application from Home.
Both off: \"Closing software\" (no warning if quitting directly with X)
- SaveData: \"Do you want to close \[\...\]? (Unsaved data will b
lost.)\"
AutoSave: ?
Both on: \"Saving data and closing software\...\" (no warning i
quitting directly with X)

**\'Optimal Animation Default Frame\' (for BNR)**
This is a float, indicating the preferred (or \'most representative\'
frame for the banner animation.

**CEC (StreetPass) ID**
This u32 represents the application CEC ID. This is likely loaded by
applications for use with the CEC services as well.
