# 3DS Files - Archive arcless


### arcless Format
This is a very simple archive format, found in some LZ-compressed files, eg. in 3DS Sound and 3DS Camera (RomFS:\\lyt\\C.LZ and RomFS:\\shaders\\shaders.LZ), 3DS Picture Picker (RomFS:\\sound\\csnd.LZ), and also in uncompressed form, eg. 3DS Sound (RomFS:\\res\\S.pack).

```

The header doesn\'t contain any ID (like \"NARC\", \"SARC\", or \"darc\" or so). However, one can more or less reliably detect it by checking for valid ASCII characters, zeropaddings, 1st Offset being located after the directory, further Offsets being located at Offset+Size+Alignment from previous entry, and with Offset+Size not exceeding the archive size.
