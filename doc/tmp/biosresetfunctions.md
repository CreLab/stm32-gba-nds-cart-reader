# BIOS Reset Functions


SoftReset
RegisterRamReset
HardReset

**SWI 00h (GBA/NDS7/NDS9) - SoftReset**
Clears 200h bytes of RAM (containing stacks, and BIOS IRQ vector/flags),
initializes system, supervisor, and irq stack pointers, sets R0-R12,
LR_svc, SPSR_svc, LR_irq, and SPSR_irq to zero, and enters system mode.
Note that the NDS9 stack registers are hardcoded (the DTCM base should
be set to the default setting of 0800000h). The NDS9 function
additionally flushes caches and write buffer, and sets the CP15 control
register to 12078h.

```

- The NDS7/NDS9 return addresses at \[27FFE34h/27FFE24h\] are usuall
- containing copies of Cartridge Header \[034h/024h\] entry points, whic
may select ARM/THUMB state via bit0. The GBA return address 8bit flag is
interpreted as 00h=8000000h (ROM), or 01h-FFh=2000000h (RAM), entered in
ARM state.
Note: The reset is applied only to the CPU that has executed the SWI
(ie. on the NDS, the other CPU will remain unaffected).
Return: Does not return to calling procedure, instead, loads the above
return address into R14, and then jumps to that address by a \"BX R14\
opcode.

**SWI 01h (GBA) - RegisterRamReset**
Resets the I/O registers and RAM specified in ResetFlags. However, it
does not clear the CPU internal RAM area from 3007E00h-3007FFFh.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Return: No return value.
Bug: LSBs of SIODATA32 are always destroyed, even if Bit5 of R0 was
cleared.
The function always switches the screen into forced blank by setting
DISPCNT=0080h (regardless of incoming R0, screen becomes white).

**SWI 26h (GBA) - HardReset (Undocumented)**
This function reboots the GBA (including for getting through the
time-consuming nintendo intro, which is making the function particularly
useless and annoying).
Parameters: None. Return: Never/Reboot.
Execution Time: About 2 seconds (!)
