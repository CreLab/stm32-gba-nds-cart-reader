# ARM Classic vs UAL Syntax (Unified Assembler Language)


ARM has changed the ARM/THUMB syntax (apparently at some point between
ARMv6 and ARMv6K). The new UAL syntax contains some cosmetic changes,
and fixes some serious flaws in the old THUMB syntax.
GBA/NDS software did traditionally use old syntax. DSi software
probably, too. 3DS software uses ARMv6K, so it\'s more likely to use th
new UAL syntax.

**THUMB code with {S} suffix**
Most ALU opcodes do always affect flags in THUMB mode, although they
were written without {S} suffix in Pre-UAL syntax, which is problematic
because the same source code can behave differently for ARM and THUMB.
MOV/ADD/SUB don\'t affect flags when using SP, PC, or R8..R15 a
source/dest operands.
MOV/ADD have variants that don\'t affect flags for operands R0..R
(these variants were originally undocumented/reserved; the flag-less CPY
variant was officially allowed in ARMv6, the flag-less ADD seems to be
allowed (?) in UAL).
MOV is a total mess because it relies on poorly defined pseudo opcodes
(in the Pre-UAL syntax it was common to encode it as ADD{S} opcode,
which destroyed the C,V flags).

```

These changes are solving compatibility issues between ARM and THUMB
code. However, in case of MOV and ADD they do bring up compatibility
issues between old and new THUMB code.

**Renamed Opcodes**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Pre-UAL               UAL                                       |
|       LDR{cond}{xx}         LDR{xx}{cond}              ;\             
|       ADD{co                                                          |
| nd}{S}          ADD{S}{cond}               ; cond suffix moved to end |

|       LDRD                                                            |
- |  Rd,[addr]        LDRD Rd,Rd+1,[addr]        ;\double word load/store 
- |       STRD Rd,[addr]        STRD Rd,Rd+1,[addr]        ;/             |
|                                                                       |
| SWI (software irq)    SVC (supervisior)          ;-renamed SWI to SVC |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Alternate Opcode Names**
Some opcodes had different names in classic ARM/THUMB syntax, UAL syntax
allows to use either one in both ARM and THUMB mode.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       THUMB-style           ARM-style                                 |
|       PUSH rlist            STMFD r13!,rlist           ;\PUSH/POP     
|       POP rlist             LDMFD r13!,rlist           ;/             |
|       NEG{S} Rd,Rs          RSB{S} Rd,Rs,0             ;-NEG/RSB      |
|       LSL{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,LSL shift     ;\             
|       LSR{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,LSR shift     ;              |
|       ASR{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,ASR shift     ; MOV/SHIFT    |
|       ROR{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,ROR shift     ;              |
|       RRX{S} Rd,Rn          MOV{S} Rd,Rn,RRX           ;/             |
|                                                                       |
|   CMD{S} Rd,Op2         CMD{S} Rd,Rd,Op2           ;-long/short forms |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**Further UAL changes**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       NOP:                                                            |
|  uses new dedicated NOP opcodes (instead of MOV Rd,Rd pseudo opcodes) |
|       LDMIA: should omit "!" if Rn in rlist                           |
- |       LDR Rd,[pc,#offset]: should be somehow written as LDR Rd,label  |
|                                                                       |
|    Newer opcodes (for ARMv6K and up) seem to exist only in UAL syntax |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Moreover, unrelated to UAL syntax, the 4-letter LDSB/LDSH/STSB/STSH
THUMB opcodes seem have been renamed to LDRSB/LDRSH/STRSB/STRSH at some
point. And, SUB SP,imm seems to have been added as an official THUMB
alias for ADD SP,-imm.
