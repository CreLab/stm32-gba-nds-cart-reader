# ARM Classic vs UAL Syntax (Unified Assembler Language)


ARM has changed the ARM/THUMB syntax (apparently at some point between ARMv6 and ARMv6K). The new UAL syntax contains some cosmetic changes, and fixes some serious flaws in the old THUMB syntax.
GBA/NDS software did traditionally use old syntax. DSi software probably, too. 3DS software uses ARMv6K, so it\'s more likely to use the new UAL syntax.

### THUMB code with {S} suffix
Most ALU opcodes do always affect flags in THUMB mode, although they were written without {S} suffix in Pre-UAL syntax, which is problematic because the same source code can behave differently for ARM and THUMB.
MOV/ADD/SUB don\'t affect flags when using SP, PC, or R8..R15 as source/dest operands.
MOV/ADD have variants that don\'t affect flags for operands R0..R7 (these variants were originally undocumented/reserved; the flag-less CPY variant was officially allowed in ARMv6, the flag-less ADD seems to be allowed (?) in UAL).
MOV is a total mess because it relies on poorly defined pseudo opcodes (in the Pre-UAL syntax it was common to encode it as ADD{S} opcode, which destroyed the C,V flags).

```

These changes are solving compatibility issues between ARM and THUMB code. However, in case of MOV and ADD they do bring up compatibility issues between old and new THUMB code.

### Renamed Opcodes

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Pre-UAL               UAL                                                   |
|       LDR{cond}{xx}         LDR{xx}{cond}              ;\                         
|       ADD{cond}{S}          ADD{S}{cond}               ; cond suffix moved to end |
|       xxx{cond}{xx}         xxx{xx}{cond}              ;/                         |
|       LDMIA                 LDM                        ;\amod IA can be ommited

|       LDRD Rd,[addr]        LDRD Rd,Rd+1,[addr]        ;\double word load/store   
|       STRD Rd,[addr]        STRD Rd,Rd+1,[addr]        ;/                         |
|       SWI (software irq)    SVC (supervisior)          ;-renamed SWI to SVC       |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Alternate Opcode Names
Some opcodes had different names in classic ARM/THUMB syntax, UAL syntax allows to use either one in both ARM and THUMB mode.

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       THUMB-style           ARM-style                                     |
|       PUSH rlist            STMFD r13!,rlist           ;\PUSH/POP         
|       POP rlist             LDMFD r13!,rlist           ;/                 |
|       NEG{S} Rd,Rs          RSB{S} Rd,Rs,0             ;-NEG/RSB          |
|       LSL{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,LSL shift     ;\                 
|       LSR{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,LSR shift     ;                  |
|       ASR{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,ASR shift     ; MOV/SHIFT        |
|       ROR{S} Rd,Rn,shift    MOV{S} Rd,Rn,ROR shift     ;                  |
|       RRX{S} Rd,Rn          MOV{S} Rd,Rn,RRX           ;/                 |
|       CMD{S} Rd,Op2         CMD{S} Rd,Rd,Op2           ;-long/short forms |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Further UAL changes

```
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       NOP: uses new dedicated NOP opcodes (instead of MOV Rd,Rd pseudo opcodes) |
|       LDMIA: should omit "!" if Rn in rlist                                     |
|       LDR Rd,[pc,#offset]: should be somehow written as LDR Rd,label            |
|       Newer opcodes (for ARMv6K and up) seem to exist only in UAL syntax        |
+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Moreover, unrelated to UAL syntax, the 4-letter LDSB/LDSH/STSB/STSH THUMB opcodes seem have been renamed to LDRSB/LDRSH/STRSB/STRSH at some point. And, SUB SP,imm seems to have been added as an official THUMB alias for ADD SP,-imm.
