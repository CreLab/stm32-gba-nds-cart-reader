# GBA Sound Channel 4 - Noise


This channel is used to output white noise. This is done by randomly
switching the amplitude between high and low at a given frequency.
Depending on the frequency the noise will appear \'harder\' o
\'softer\'.

It is also possible to influence the function of the random generator,
so the that the output becomes more regular, resulting in a limited
ability to output Tone instead of Noise.

The Length value is used only if Bit 6 in NR44 is set.

**400007Ch - SOUND4CNT_H (NR43, NR44) - Channel 4 Frequency/Control
(R/W)**
The amplitude is randomly switched between high and low at the given
frequency. A higher frequency will make the noise to appear \'softer\'.
When Bit 3 is set, the output will become more regular, and some
frequencies will sound more like Tone than Noise.

Frequency = 524288 Hz / r / 2\^(s+1) ;For r=0 assume r=0.5 instead

**Noise Random Generator (aka Polynomial Counter)**
Noise randomly switches between HIGH and LOW levels, the output levels
are calculated by a shift register (X), at the selected frequency, as
such:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |
|    7bit:  X=X SHR 1, IF carry THEN Out=HIGH, X=X XOR 60h ELSE Out=LOW |
|                                                                       |
|  15bit: X=X SHR 1, IF carry THEN Out=HIGH, X=X XOR 6000h ELSE Out=LOW |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The initial value when (re-)starting the sound is X=40h (7bit) or
X=4000h (15bit). The data stream repeats after 7Fh (7bit) or 7FFFh
(15bit) steps.
