**Certificate Chain (A00h bytes, with three certificates)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       R                                                               |
| SA-4096 for below certificates (Retail=CA00000003, or Dev=CA00000004) |
|       R                                                               |
| SA-2048 for Ticket signature   (Retail=XS0000000c, or Dev=XS00000009) |
|       R                                                               |
| SA-2048 for TMD signature      (Retail=CP0000000b, or Dev=CP0000000a) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The same three certificates are also stored in certs.db,
- [3DS Files - Title Certificates(./3dsfilestitlecertificatescertsdb.md)

**Ticket (350h bytes), with decrypt key for APP file(s)**
- [3DS Files - Title Ticket (./3dsfilestitleticketticketdb.md)

**TMD (B34h+N\*30h bytes), contains info about the separate AP
file(s)**
- [3DS Files - Title Metadata (./3dsfilestitlemetadatatmd.md)

**APP file(s)**
This region can contain one or more contents (eg. separate .app files
for executable and manual, with .app sizes as listed in the TMD file;
the .app files can be 3DS NCCH images, or DSiware images, or DSi
datafiles like DS Cart Whitelist).
The .app contents are usually encrypted using the ticket\'s titleke
(see the Ticket chapter for details).

```

|          done in most or all homebrew CIA's like ctrQuake.cia)        |

**Meta (3AC0h bytes) (if any)**

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                       |

| 400h 36C0h SMDH Icon/Title           ;from NCCH ExeFS    ;ExeFS:\icon 
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The above data block is only present for NCCH executables (DSiware files
and NCCH data files don\'t have the Exheader and ExeFS).
- [3DS Files - NCCH Extended Header](./3dsfilesncchextendedheader.md)
- [3DS Files - Video Icons (./3dsfilesvideoiconssmdh.md)

**Meta (8 bytes) (CVer USA)**
Seems to contain a copy of the \"CVer - RomFS:\\version.bin\" file.
- [3DS Files - Version (./3dsfilesversioncverandnver.md)
Confusingly, the japanese system update contains 000400db00017202.cia
(that name would be CVer USA, but the file contains CVer JPN). And
confusingly, the system update doesn\'t contain any NVer file (unknow
if/how it is updating NVer).

**APP Flags**
This appears to be a 64Kbit array with flags for Content Index
0000h..FFFFh (the first flag for index 0000h being located in bit7 of
first byte).
The number of contents and content indices are found in the TMD file
(most titles have only 1 or 2 contents, so the first flag byte is
usually 80h or C0h, followed by 1FFFh zero bytes).
Unknown if these flags are used for anything\... maybe there are case
where the TMD lists multiple APPs, but only one of them being updated in
the CIA?

**Overview**
CIA format allows the installation of titles to the 3DS. CIA files and
titles on Nintendo\'s CDN contain identical data. As a consequence
valid CIA files can be generated from CDN content. This also means CIA
files can contain anything that titles on Nintendo\'s CDN can contain
Uh, what is a CDN?

Under normal circumstances CIA files are used where downloading a title
is impractical or not possible. Such as distributing a Download Play
child, or installing forced Gamecard updates. Those CIA(s) are stored by
the titles in question, in an auxiliary CFA file.

Development Units, are capable of manually installing CIA files via the
Dev Menu.

**Format**
The CIA format has a similar structure to the Wii\'s WAD format (aka DS
Tad?).
The file is represented in little-endian.
The data is aligned in 40h-byte blocks (if a content ends at the middle
of the block, the next content will begin from a new block).


```

| ____________________ System Update CFA ______________________________ |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


This system update CFA contains the below files in the RomFS. This CFA
is stored in the NCSD system-update partition (partition 7), the data
from this CFA RomFS can also be transferred for Download Play when the
client needs updated.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

|       ROM Cart NCSD Partition 7, NCCH RomFS:\*.cia           ;/       
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**cup_list**
This uses the same format as the CVer cup_list, this system-update CFA
cup_list contains the titleIDs for all of the titles stored in this
RomFS.
- [3DS Files - Version (./3dsfilesversioncverandnver.md)

**\<titleID\>.cia**
This is the CIA for each system-update title, for retail gamecards these
CIAs are generated from the titles available on CDN at the time the NCSD
image was finalized. The latest version(at the time of CFA generation)
of every system title from CDN is stored here, excluding titles with the
title-versions for 1.0.0-0.

**New3DS**
New3DS system-update partitions are located at partition6 in gamecards.
The RomFS contains a \"SNAKE\" directory, the contents of that director
have the same structure as the Old3DS sysupdate CFA RomFS.

The order of the sections in the CIA file:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

| ro Data (aka dummy Meta?) (but here with Meta in front of APP area!?) |
|                                                                       |
|     * APP file data (unencrypted, as there's no ticket with titlekey) |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Only one executable supported. Uh, are there MORE than one
\"executable\" supported in later versions??? With different titl
IDs??? But that would somewhat require multiple TMD\'s and Ticket\'s?

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Very similar to the final CIA version (encryption, TMD, etc), except
there is no embedded Certificate Chain.

**Late 2010**
The final version was invented in late 2010 (and, with the 3DS being
released in 2011, retail CIA\'s are probably always using the fina
version).
