There are some datasheets & source code:

The overall hardware registers appear to be same for all AR60xx chips
(no matter if they contain MIPS or Xtensa CPUs). The AR6002 datasheet
doesn\'t contain ANY details about hardware registers. The AR600
datasheet describes SOME hardware registers. And, the AR6K source code
contains details about MORE undocumented hardware registers (in some
cases listing DIFFERENT addresses as in the datasheet).
The AR6013/AR6014 chips are probably custom designs with some extra
MM3218 emulation for NDS games (and possible with some unknown extra
hardware features).

**BPTWL**
Apart from SDIO bus, some wifi functions are also controlled by the
BPTWL chip (accessed via I2C bus). The wifi related BPTWL signals are:

```

|       ATH                                                             |
| _TX_H              ;\maybe some/all of these do just indicate traffic 
|                                                                       |
| WL_RXPE               ; (for blinking the wifi LED, if it is enabled) |
|       WL_TXPE               ;/                                        |
|       /WIFI_RST             ;-Reset or so                             |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

That signals seem to be used with BPTWL register 30h, which is allowing
to disable the Wifi LED, and might also allow to do things like restting
the Wifi hardware, and/or switching between NDS and DSi wifi-modes.
