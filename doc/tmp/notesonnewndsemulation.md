# Notes on New NDS Emulation


Hello to newer no\$gba version(s) with NDS support. Most of it i
working fine by now, a few details are still under construction. The
most important (missing) things to be aware of are:

**Major Missing Features**
WLAN emulation is almost complete (but still incompatible with
commercial games) (parts for transfer timing reasons, and parts because
nobody knows yet how multiplayer packets work).
3D emulation is almost complete, too, only missing feature is
Anti-Aliasing.

**Things that work only with real NDS-BIOS-image**
The \"decompression-with-callback\" BIOS functions are currently workin
only if you do have a copy of the real BIOSes as ROM-images (see
Installation and DS Xboo chapters).
Encrypted ROM-images (with encrypted first 2Kbytes of the secure area)
can be used only if the (full) NDS7 BIOS ROM-image is present (which
contains the 1048h-byte decryption seed data).

**Minor Missing Features and Glitches (in NDS mode)**
VRAM viewer Tile/OBJ windows don\'t work.
Saving Snapshots doesn\'t work yet.
Backup media type isn\'t autodetected.

**Recommended TCM Areas**
No\$gba decodes memory blocks by examining address bits24-27 (so memor
is split into 16MB blocks). TCM emulation works fastest if DTCM and ITCM
are each located at the bottom of free 16MB blocks (ie. blocks that do
not contain other memory, such like WRAM, VRAM, etc.), recommended
ITCM/DTCM base addresses would be:

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```
|       ITCM at 00000000h, or (mirrored to) 01000000h.                  |
|                                                                       |
|     DTCM at 01000000h, 0B000000h, 0C000000h, 0D000000h, or 0E000000h. |
```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

Other addresses are supported by no\$gba v2.2c and up, for example, th
Metroid Demo uses DTCM base overlapping with the Main Memory region, a
possible advantage is that DTCM & Main RAM can be used as continous
memory region, however, the emulation performance won\'t be optimal.

**Note**
Use Ctrl+T in debug mode to toggle between the two CPUs.
