# LCD VRAM Bitmap BG Modes


In BG Modes 3-5 the background is defined in form of a bitmap (unlike as
for Tile/Map based BG modes). Bitmaps are implemented as BG2, with
Rotation/Scaling support. As bitmap modes are occupying 80KBytes of BG
memory, only 16KBytes of VRAM can be used for OBJ tiles.

**BG Mode 3 - 240x160 pixels, 32768 colors**
Two bytes are associated to each pixel, directly defining one of the
32768 colors (without using palette data, and thus not supporting a
\'transparent\' BG color).

|       0-4   Red Intensity   (0-31)                                    |
|       5-9   Green Intensity (0-31)                                    |
|       10-14 Blue Intensity  (0-31)                                    |
|       15    No                                                        |

```

The first 480 bytes define the topmost line, the next 480 the next line,
and so on. The background occupies 75 KBytes (06000000-06012BFF), most
of the 80 Kbytes BG area, not allowing to redraw an invisible second
frame in background, so this mode is mostly recommended for still images
only.

**BG Mode 4 - 240x160 pixels, 256 colors (out of 32768 colors)**
One byte is associated to each pixel, selecting one of the 256 palette
entries. Color 0 (backdrop) is transparent, and OBJs may be displayed
behind the bitmap.
The first 240 bytes define the topmost line, the next 240 the next line,
and so on. The background occupies 37.5 KBytes, allowing two frames to
be used (06000000-060095FF for Frame 0, and 0600A000-060135FF for Frame
1).

**BG Mode 5 - 160x128 pixels, 32768 colors**
Colors are defined as for Mode 3 (see above), but horizontal and
vertical size are cut down to 160x128 pixels only - smaller than the
physical dimensions of the LCD screen.
The background occupies exactly 40 KBytes, so that BG VRAM may be split
into two frames (06000000-06009FFF for Frame 0, and 0600A000-06013FFF
for Frame 1).

In BG modes 4,5, one Frame may be displayed (selected by DISPCNT Bit 4),
the other Frame is invisible and may be redrawn in background.
