# GBA Cartridge ROM


**ROM Size**
The games F-ZERO and Super Mario Advance use ROMs of 4 MBytes each.
Zelda uses 8 MBytes. Not sure if other sizes are manufactured.

**ROM Waitstates**
The GBA starts the cartridge with 4,2 waitstates (N,S) and prefetch
disabled. The program may change these settings by writing to WAITCNT,
the games F-ZERO and Super Mario Advance use 3,1 waitstates (N,S) each,
with prefetch enabled.
Third-party flashcards are reportedly running unstable with these
settings. Also, prefetch and shorter waitstates are allowing to read
more data and opcodes from ROM is less time, the downside is that it
increases the power consumption.

**ROM Chip**
Because of how 24bit addresses are squeezed through the Gampak bus, the
cartridge must include a circuit that latches the lower 16 address bits
on non-sequential access, and that increments these bits on sequential
access. Nintendo includes this circuit directly in the ROM chip.
Also, the ROM must have 16bit data bus (or a circuit which converts two
8bit data units into one 16bit unit - by not exceeding the waitstate
timings).
