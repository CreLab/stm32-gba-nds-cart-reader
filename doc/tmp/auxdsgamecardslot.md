Chipselect High-to-Low transitions are invoking commands, which are
transmitted through data lines during next following eight CLK pulses,
after the command transmission, further CLK pulses are used to transfer
data, the data transfer ends at chipselect Low-to-High transition.
Data should be stable during CLK=LOW period throughout CLK rising edge.
Note: Supply Pins (1,8,17) are slightly longer than other pins. Pin
pitch is 1.5mm.

The DS does also have a 32pin cartridge slot, that slot is used to run
GBA carts in GBA mode, it can be also used as expansion port in DS
mode.
