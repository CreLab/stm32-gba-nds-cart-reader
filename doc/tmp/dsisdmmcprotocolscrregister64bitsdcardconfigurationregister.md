**SD Configuration Register (SCR)**
In addition to the CSD register, there is another configuration register
named SD CARD Configuration Register (SCR). SCR provides information on
the SD Memory Card\'s special features that were configured into th
given card. The size of SCR register is 64 bits. This register shall be
set in the factory by the SD Memory Card manufacturer.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The requirements of supporting commands mentioned above are for the
optional commands, the support of which depends on versions (SD_SPEC,
SD_SPEC3 and SD_SPEC4). Refer to Table 4-21 (and Notes below the table)
about the mandatory and optional commands in the card.

**DATA_STAT_AFTER_ERASE**
Defines the data status after erase, whether it is 0 or 1 (the status is
card vendor dependent).

**SD_SECURITY**
This field indicates CPRM Security Specification Version for each
capacity card. The definition of Protected Area is different in each
capacity card.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       00h           No Security                                       |
|       01h           Not Used                                          |
|       02h           SDSC Card (CPRM Security Version 1.01)            |
|       03h           SDHC Card (CPRM Security Version 2.00)            |
|       04h           SDXC Card (CPRM Security Version 3.xx)            |
|       05h-07h       Reserved                                          |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The basic rule of setting this field:

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       SDSC Card sets this field to 2 (Version 1.01).                  |
|       SDHC Card sets this field to 3 (Version 2.00).                  |
|       SDXC Card sets this field to 4 (Version 3.xx).                  |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Note that it is mandatory for a regular writable SD Memory Card to
support Security Protocol. For ROM (Read Only) and OTP (One Time
Programmable) types of the SD Memory Card, the security feature is
optional.

**SD_BUS_WIDTHS**
Describes all the DAT bus widths that are supported by this card.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit 3          Reserved                                         |
|       Bit 2          4 bit (DAT0-3)                                   |
|       Bit 1          Reserved                                         |
|       Bit 0          1 bit (DAT0)                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

Since the SD Memory Card shall support at least the two bus modes 1-bit
or 4-bit width, then any SD Card shall set at least bits 0 and 2
(SD_BUS_WIDTH=\"0101\").

**EX_SECURITY**
This field indicates Extended Security which is defined by the Part A4
Data Protection System Specification Version 1.00 or will be defined by
a later version of the Part 3 Security Specification Version 3.00.

```

- |           Part A4 Data Protection System Specification. SCR[46-45] is |
|                      reserved for future extension.                   |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


**CMD_SUPPORT**
Support bit of new commands are defined to Bit 33-32 (uh, 35-32?) of
SCR.

```
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       Bit Supported Command               Command  CCC  Remark        |
