# 3DS GPU Pitfalls


### Vertex attribute alignment
Vertex components which are defined through GPUREG_ATTR_BUFi_CONFIG_LOW will be accessed aligned by the GPU.
Vertex attributes will be aligned to their component element size.
Padding attributes (Component type \> 11) will always aligned to 4 byte offets into the buffer.
The stride which is passed to the GPU should be passed unaligned.

### Vertex stride in GPUREG_ATTR_BUFi_CONFIG_HIGH
The vertex stride set in GPUREG_ATTR_BUFi_CONFIG_HIGH must match the actual size of the vertex contained in the buffer or the PICA will freeze or it won\'t draw anything.
If you want to use a different stride you have to pad the data accordingly with padding attributes.

### Output mapping in GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_MASK
The output masking in GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_MASK influences how the registers starting at GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_Oi map to outputs in the shader.

If an output is disabled in GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_MASK it means that no slot in the GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_Oi registers is consumed. GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_TOTAL configures the number of used consecutive slots in the outmap. Example:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_TOTAL = 0x00000002      ;2 outputs enabled                   |
|       GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_MASK  = 0x00000011      ;o0 enabled, o4 enabled              |
|       GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_O0    = 0x03020100      ;o0 = pos.xyzw                       |
|       GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_O1    = 0x0B0A0908      ;o4 = color.rgba    ;<-- o4 in "O1"! |
|       GPUREG_SH_OUTMAP_O2    = ...             ;(unused)                            |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
```


### Shaders - Configued Output components must be written exactly once
Each configured output component has to be written exactly once or the PICA freezes.

### Shaders - MOVA instructions can\'t be adjacent
Having 2 consecutive MOVA instructions will freeze the PICA. This can be relaxed by placing a NOP between 2 MOVAs or by rearranging the code.

### Shader - Special cases
JMP overwrites the PC \*after\* the stacks checks (and only if no stack was popped).
Executing a BREAK on an empty LOOP stack hangs the GPU.
A stack overflow discards the oldest element, so you could think of it as a queue or a ring buffer.
If the CALL stack is popped four times in a row, the fourth update to its copy of the PC is missed (the third PC update will be propagated). Probably a hardware bug.

### Shader - Floating-Point Behavior
The PICA200 is not IEEE-compliant. It has positive and negative infinities and NaN, but does not seem to have negative 0. Input and output subnormals are flushed to +0. The internal floating point format seems to be the same as used in shader binaries: 1 sign bit, 7 exponent bits, 16 (explicit) mantissa bits. Several instructions also have behavior that differs from the IEEE functions. Here are the results from some tests done on hardware (s = largest subnormal, n = smallest positive normal):

```

1.0 can be multiplied 63 times by 0.5 until the result compares equal zero. This is consistent with a 7-bit exponent and output subnormal flushing.

Invalid GPU command parameters including NaN floats can cause the GPU to hang, which then causes the \"GSP module\" to hang as well.
